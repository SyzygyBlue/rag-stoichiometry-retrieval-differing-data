For four days in this hellhole, it felt like the room itself was conspiring to drag them under. The flickering holoscreen in the corner hissed and crackled, its fractured display throwing jagged shadows across the walls. Ads looped endlessly, distorted and shrill, the sound like an insect's death rattle. The walls bore the scars of old graffiti—names, crude drawings, desperate pleas etched into flaking paint. The carpet, once green, was now a patchwork of piss-stained brown, reeking of decay and failure. Every breath Quincy took carried the stench of sweat, cheap hash, and the sour tang of old mistakes, rising from the sagging mattresses whenever they shifted.
She had counted each of the four days since they dragged Chase off the cybermancer’s table and into this motel. He had woken up a handful of times—just long enough to eat, drink, and shuffle to the tiny, ad-ridden bathroom—but then he’d crash again, slipping back into uneasy, restless sleep. Each time, Quincy thought maybe this was it, that he’d finally stay awake long enough to talk. And each time, he drifted off again, leaving her alone with her fraying nerves and a mounting pile of problems she didn’t know how to solve.
Chase had to step up, even if it meant giving him a kick in the ass.
Quincy stood at the room's center, arms crossed, tension coiled tight in her chest. Her eyes lingered on Chase, sprawled across the bed, his face slack in uneasy sleep. His chest rose and fell in slow, steady breaths, but the rest of him looked alien. That arm—blue as an oil slick, black joints gleaming in the dim light — was a betrayal. It wasn't him. Not yet. Maybe not ever. It twitched faintly, a mechanical jerk, and her heart seized. Was he dreaming, or was that... something else? She didn’t know.
And she hated not knowing.
The faint groan of pipes sounded through the paper-thin walls, followed by a toilet flush. From next door came the buzz of another holovid ad, its voice cheerful and insidious, promising a better world to anyone who still had the credits to buy one. Quincy’s lip curled. Here, even survival came with a price tag — flushing, showering, breathing without choking on the ads.
On the couch, Lesha lay sprawled like a broken doll, her body slack, her breath shallow. Sykotiq had her locked in that numb, floating space just this side of death, and Quincy hated herself for thinking it was better this way. Better than watching her claw at her arms, shaking, begging for relief. The drug kept her quiet, but it also kept her gone. And Quincy needed her back. Lesha might be the wisest person Quincy had ever known.
Demmy sat against the far wall, pale and greasy, his eyes open but empty. He hadn’t been the same since Fox River. Evelyn was gone — the name of someone he moaned in his sleep. His home was gone. His dreams were ash, and so was he. He didn’t even fight anymore — not with his words, not with his fists. He just... existed. A ghost in a body that refused to quit.
Quincy looked at them all — the broken pieces of a crew she didn’t ask for but couldn’t bear to lose. These were her people now, or what was left of them. And she was holding them together with fraying thread and sheer willpower. The weight of it sat heavy in her chest, coiling tighter with every passing hour. She’d fought too hard, lost too much to let them slip through her fingers now. But she couldn’t do it alone. She needed help.
She needed Chase.
He stirred, a groan escaping his lips as his eyes fluttered open. Quincy’s breath hitched as she took a step closer, her arms dropping to her sides. The light caught his new arm again, and her stomach twisted. It wasn’t him, not really. But it was what they had now.
“Chase,” she said, her voice sharp...too sharp to be ignored.
He groaned again, trying to push himself up, his cybernetic arm jerking awkwardly. She raised a hand to stop him.
“Don’t. Just... stay there,” she said. “We need to talk.”
His eyes flicked to her, confusion clouding his face before bitterness sharpened it. He scoffed, his lips curling into a bitter sneer.
“You want to talk? Now?” His voice was low, gravelly. “You’re kidding me, right? Of all the times, Quincy, this is when you want a conversation?”
Quincy didn’t flinch. She was too far past that.
“Yeah, now,” she said bluntly. “I let you sleep for four days, Chase. I didn’t say shit when you got up to eat or piss or whatever and crawled right back into bed. But we can’t keep waiting for you to pull yourself together. We’re out of time.”
He turned his head away, staring at the cracked ceiling.
“You don’t get it,” he muttered, his words dripping with bitterness. “It’s all gone. Fox River. My mom. My arm. My eye. Everything. Gone.”
Quincy took a breath, steadying herself, and her voice softened — but only just.
“I know, Chase,” she said, the weight of her words pressing into the space between them. “I’m so sorry you’re going through this. I’m so fucking sorry I have to stand here and say this. But Chase, we’re in the shit. Everybody we know is dead or missing, and we’re hanging on by our fingernails. I know I’ve doubted you. Hell, I’ve second-guessed you more times than I can count. I've been a raging bitch, and you didn't deserve it. And I'm sorry. But right now, I need you.”
Chase sighed, running his good hand through his hair. 
“I think I just need a little more time, Quincy,” he said, almost a whisper. "I'm sure I'll feel better soon."
Quincy barked a short, humorless laugh. 
“You think the people who killed your family and kidnapped mine care how you feel?” she snapped, her voice cutting. “Chase, we’re the last ones left. We can’t just lay down and die.”
Chase stared at her, his expression unreadable, but the tension in his jaw gave him away.
"Quincy, why does it have to be me right now?" he asked.
Quincy sniffed, took a ragged breath, and blew it out.
"Because I can't do it all by myself. Come on, Chase, you know me. I've got no finesse. I just get frustrated and go right fucking up the middle and kick down doors and alienate everybody around me. There are times that really works, but not right now. Right now, what we need is friends who can help us find out what's going on. We need allies that can help us fight. That's not my strength. It's yours. I need you. We all do. Please, Chase, help me figure this shit out.”
The anger in his eyes faltered, replaced by something deeper. Sorrow. He turned his head away, staring at the cracked ceiling. Tears slipped silently down the sides of his face.
“You’re asking for a lot,” he whispered, his voice hollow, raw. “More than you realize.”
“I know I am,” Quincy said, swallowing hard. “I wish I could give you more time. But we don’t have it. We have to move.”
Chase’s face twisted in frustration, his good hand balling into a fist. He opened his mouth to snap back, but Quincy continued, her tone resolute, steady.
"Listen, I’m not going anywhere. I told you back in that filthy cell I wouldn’t leave your side, and I fucking meant it. I made a promise. I’m keeping it. But I can’t drag your ass through this, Chase. You’ve got to meet me halfway. You’ve got to wake the hell up and help me figure this out."
Chase let out a ragged breath, his new arm twitching slightly as he tried to move it. The joints clicked and whirred. He scowled at it, gritted his teeth. After a moment he closed his eyes and shook his head.
"This thing... it’s awkward. It doesn’t do what I tell it."
"Lesha said it’ll get better soon," Quincy nodded, forcing a small smile, her own grateful tears rolling down her face. "She says to give it a few weeks, and it’ll feel like it’s part of you."
He huffed, not entirely convinced, but he didn’t argue. Instead, he shifted slightly, wincing. 
"My eyes... everything’s so blurry. I can barely see." Chase squinted.
"Lesha and the cybermance both said it would clear up," Quincy reassured him. "Once the healing’s done, they say it'll be better than the ones you were born with."
Chase rubbed his good hand over his face, exhaling again, slower this time.
"I don’t know, Quincy," he whispered, his voice tinged with doubt. "I’m just raw nerves, emotions, pain. My whole life’s on fire. It’s all burning."
Quincy reached out, gently placing her hand on his shoulder.
"You can do this," she said, her voice quiet but firm. "I’ve seen you pull through shit no one else could. This is no different. We’ll get through this together. We’re not done yet."
Chase looked at her, the sorrow still in his eyes, but something else flickered alongside it — determination, faint but growing. After a few heartbeats, he nodded. He didn't say anything else, just the nod. For Quincy, it was enough. The tension in her shoulders began to ease. Quincy gave his shoulder a gentle squeeze, her gaze unwavering.
"We’ll get through this," she said softly. "We’re each other’s family now."
