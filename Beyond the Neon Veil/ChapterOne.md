### **Run for your Lives**

The narrow streets of Gdańsk blurred as Stanislav pushed the engine to its limit, a caged beast roaring its defiance. Holographic signs, a dizzying mix of real and Stella AR, flickered from storefronts, their reflections dancing off the wet pavement and the gleaming black sedans closing in. The Krov i Lyod cars were relentless predators, gliding through the chaos with unsettling precision.

The night erupted in a cacophony of gunfire, each shot a sharp crack that echoed through the streets. Bullets slammed into the car, ricocheting off the pavement in cascades of sparks. Bullets whizzed past, narrowly missing their mark. Stanislav wove a desperate path through the crowded streets, dodging both projectiles and vehicles. He ran a wheel up on a curb and onto the sidewalk as he roared past a truck and trailer that threatened to block their way.

The back window exploded, spraying glass shards across the interior. Stanislav winced. The sound of Svetlana’s pistol echoed alongside the chaos.

"Die, you synowie dziwek!" she screamed, her voice raw with fury as she leaned out of the passenger window. Her chrome arms, delicate yet strong, absorbed the recoil of her 9mm as she fired round after round.

"Keep your head down!" Stanislav barked, glancing at Svetlana. 

Defiance burned in her emerald eyes. She leaned out the window, her metallic arms steady despite the car's violent swerves. The pistol in her hand bucked with each shot, the muzzle flashes illuminating her face. Her mane of red hair billowed out behind her like flames.

A bullet found its mark.

Svetlana jerked back into the car, her hand flying to her neck. Blood ran down, staining the collar of her dress.

"You're hit!" Stanislav yelled, eyes going wide as he stared at her wound.

"I'm fine!" she snapped, her hand clamping down on the deep groove in her skin. Blood, a stark contrast against the chrome, welled between her fingers. Pain flashed in her eyes, then vanished, replaced by a grim determination. "Drive!"

Stanislav wrenched the wheel, narrowly avoiding a collision with a pile of spilled crates. 

"They're armored!" he yelled, glancing at the ghostly projection of the Gdańsk map that overlayed via his PID. He scanned for an alternative route, but nothing stood out. "Get back in the car! You're not doing anything!"

"Then drive faster!" Svetlana retorted, ejecting a spent magazine and sliding in another with practiced ease.

He jerked the wheel, narrowly avoiding another hail of bullets. The car fishtailed, just missing a parked truck as it careened onto a wider avenue. In the distance, the canal shimmered, a dark ribbon reflecting the city's faint glow. Along its banks, cranes, illuminated by work lights, loaded and unloaded containers onto waiting ships.

Ahead, the road narrowed, leading toward the tunnel at Aleja Macieja Płażyńskiego. The car's rear end swung out, tires scrabbling for grip on the treacherous asphalt. Stanislav fought the wheel, his muscles tense, his jaw clenched.

"Take the tunnel!" Svetlana screamed, her voice shrill with desperation. Her chrome arms gleamed under the flickering streetlights as she leaned out of the passenger window, firing again with unrelenting fury.

"Insanity!" Stanislav shouted back, his voice strained as he fought to control the car. "It's suicide if we get stuck!"

"Do it! I have a plan!" she snarled, firing off another shot. The muzzle flashes illuminated her bloodied face, the gash on her neck still seeping crimson onto her emerald dress. She pointed at a large box truck several cars ahead. "See that truck? Get in front of it before we get in the tunnel!"

He didn't waste time arguing. The sedans were closing in, their headlights cutting through the mist like raptor's talons. He slammed the shifter into a lower gear and gunned the throttle, winding up the engine's RPMs into a high-pitched wail as he barreled around two cars on the way to the entrance to the tunnel.

The tunnel amplified the chaos: the engine's roar, the screech of tires, the metallic scream of their car's door against the tunnel wall. Sparks erupted as Stanislav forced the car past the truck, the narrow passage a gauntlet of noise and danger. Horns blared, and the truck driver’s furious shouts were lost in the cacophony of shattering glass and cracking gunfire.

"Faster! Get all the way past it!" Svetlana yelled, reloading her pistol. She stuck her head back out and drew down on the delivery truck's front tire and fired three shots, causing an immediate blowout, sending the heavy truck careening...tilting...eventually rolling. The overturned truck lay across the tunnel, a mangled barricade. Only one sedan managed to squeeze past, its roof ripped open in a grotesque parody of a convertible.

"Damnit, that almost worked!" Stanislav barked, glancing in the rearview mirror. The damaged sedan was still behind them, it's roof twisted back like the lid on a food tin.

"Almost doesn't count for shit," Svetlana screamed, sticking her head back out and firing the pistol dry yet again.

Svetlana’s emerald eyes darted toward the tunnel’s exit, where the faint glow of streetlights hinted at open air. She ejected the spent magazine and jacked in the final one she had.

"The bridge," she said suddenly, her voice cutting through the noise. "We go to the bridge!"

"Why?" Stanislav demanded, his voice edged with panic.

"We're not making it on land!" Svetlana shouted over the roar of the engine and the pursuing cars. "One mag left, and it's useless against their armor! Our only chance is in the water. We swim!"

Stanislav cursed under his breath, but he didn’t argue. The petrol gauge was dropping rapidly, the needle sinking toward empty. They didn’t have much time.

The tunnel's exit rushed towards them, a beacon of hope in the suffocating darkness. Stanislav slammed his foot down, urging the car onward.

Looming ahead, the bridge's sweeping arch was lit by floodlights. Below, the inky black waters of the near-frozen canal stretched out, reflecting the faint glow of the city skyline. On the water's edge were the docks, along which were moored several ships piled high with shipping containers, brightly lit as workers operated the cranes that loaded and unloaded cargo.

The bridge—their only escape. He swerved onto it, tires losing their grip on the slick asphalt. The car lurched, threatening to spin out of control. Stanislav fought it, wrestling the wheel, his knuckles bone-white. For a heart-stopping moment, he thought they were lost. Then, somehow, he regained control. Behind them, the damaged Krov i Lyod sedan surged forward, the torque of the electric motor driving it like a predator closing in for the kill.

A bullet punched through the trunk, ricocheting off the interior with a sickening thud. Another shattered the side mirror, sending shards of glass flying.

"Fuel tank's leaking! We’re out of time!" Stanislav shouted, glancing at the fuel gauge. The needle was pegged against empty, the engine sputtering as the last drops of petrol burned away.

"Go!" Svetlana screamed, her voice raw with desperation. "We must get away! Run it off the bridge! Do it now!"

But the sedan behind them surged forward, its grill flashing like bared teeth. The impact came before Stanislav even had a chance to react; the Krov i Lyod car rammed into the back corner of Stanislav's vehicle, the force of the hit spinning them sideways. Stanislav fought the wheel, but the tires lost their grip, and the car slid toward the guard rail. 

"Shit!" Stanislav yelled, fighting the wheel in vain.

Out of control, both cars smashed through the metal railing in a shower of sparks and twisted steel. For one sickening moment, they were airborne. The bridge fell away, and the icy black canal rushed up to meet them.

At that moment, a massive container ship slid beneath the bridge, its bulk gliding through the dark water like a leviathan. Stanislav's car clipped the bow, the collision flipping their car end over end before it splashed into darkness with a bone-crushing impact.

Behind them, the sedan slammed into the ship's containers with a thunderous crash. Cargo toppled, snapping steel cables and spilling crates into the frosty canal. The sound was deafening, echoing off the surrounding buildings.

* * *

Freezing water and darkness blasted Stanislav's senses as the car landed roof-first, its canopy crumpling inward before flipping lazily back over. Through the shattered windshield, icy water surged in, numbing his body as it climbed past his chest.

The taste of blood filled his mouth as sharp pain bit at him — whether from the icy cold or real injury, he couldn't tell. Right now, it didn't matter.

"Svetlana!" he howled, twisting in his seat. She was pinned beneath the crumpled dashboard, her chrome arms thrashing as the water reached her neck.

"Oh god, I'm stuck!" she screamed, her emerald eyes wide with terror. One of her hands plunged between her legs, searching...

*She's stuck. She's trying to slide the seat back.*

"Stan, help me! Please!"

With trembling, frozen fingers, he fumbled at her seat belt. Maybe then...

*Come on, open, damn you!*

Finally, it released, and he lunged for Svetlana, reaching down for the release lever — except it wasn't there. His hand fumbled against the only thing that was there: her handbag — clunky — he remembered it banging against the table in the bar earlier... before all this had begun. It clunked hard against the console as he shoved it aside.

"You're stuck, and I can't find the handle to slide the seat back!" he growled, his voice cracking with desperation. "Svetlana, push, goddamnit PUSH!"

He tugged desperately, but the twisted metal held her fast. As the cold sapped his strength, the rising water surged over both their heads.

Svetlana thrashed once, twice, and then slowed, her eyes locking onto his in a silent plea. She reached out, her splayed fingers grasping at the fabric of his shirt as her mouth opened and a flood of bubbles escaped in a muffled scream. Eyes wide, her body jerked once, twice, three times — then went still. Then Svetlana's chrome arms released their grip. They dropped to her sides.

Suddenly, Stanislav was aware of his own peril. Wrenching his own seat belt free, he pushed upward, angling toward the shattered windshield. Jagged shards of glass tore at his skin as he forced his way through. A guttural scream ripped from his throat, raw with the knowledge that the car was still sinking — and that he was leaving her behind. But he had no choice: if he delayed even an instant more, he would drown.

And so he swam, wild and reckless, in the freezing pitch-black water.

Downward he plunged, the current's icy grip pulling him into the abyss. His lungs screamed for air, his vision a kaleidoscope of blurry shapes and distorted colors. He fought to swim upward, the surface light mocking him, a faint glimmer filtering in from the night sky.

His struggle felt endless — he was running out of time.

Just as darkness closed in, he broke the surface. He gulped at the air, the cold searing his lungs, each gasp a victory against the suffocating grip of the water. He blinked away the black spots clouding his vision, his world slowly returning from the brink of oblivion. The bridge loomed far behind—he'd been swept downstream. In the distance, the wreckage of the Krov i Lyod car was partially visible, poking out at a weird angle from atop the container ship.

Carried outward in the flowing water toward the bay, he caught sight of the docks with his blurred vision. They were covered in scattered piles of stacked containers and loader trucks, casting long shadows against the city’s faint glow. Shipping cranes moved like slow giants, their claws stacking metal boxes onto a second waiting ship. Stanislav turned, his breath coming in heaving gasps as he swam toward the pier.

With every stroke, his muscles screamed in protest, battling the numbing cold and relentless current. His lungs ached, his body pleaded for surrender. But he couldn't give up. Not yet. His fingers, numb and clumsy, finally closed around the rungs of a ladder that extended down to the water. He pulled himself up, collapsing onto the platform in an exhausted heap.

His soaked clothes clung like ice to his shivering frame. Blood oozed from several cuts, and his breath came in shallow, ragged bursts. He lay there. He didn't know how long, but he knew he couldn't stay. He pushed himself to his knees, clutching at a nearby shipping container for support.

Boots clanged nearby, jolting Stanislav upright. Distant dockworkers’ chatter merged with the hum of machinery. He pressed into the shadows, heart pounding. He couldn't risk being seen—Krov i Lyod wouldn’t stop looking for him—especially not after tonight.

He staggered toward the looming containers, their shadows promising a way to stay hidden. Gnawing like a relentless predator, the cold seeped into his bones. He feared the icy grip of death would claim him before Krov i Lyod could.

Each ragged breath spilled mist into the frozen night. The distant hum of the city, a symphony of life he could no longer be a part of, mocked his isolation. Every light, every sound, was a sharp reminder of what he had lost.

*Damn you, Svetlana. Damn you for dragging me into your mess. And damn you for making me watch you die* 

He wished he meant it, but his fool heart wouldn't let him. He'd deal with these thoughts later. Right now, he had to find some way out of this mess if he didn't want to share her fate...

He wished he meant it, but his fool heart wouldn't let him. He'd deal with these thoughts later. Right now, he had to find some way out of this mess if he didn't want to join her in death.

...or worse.

Krov i Lyod, if they caught him, would deal a far worse end than simply freezing to death.

His eyes caught on three containers, their doors slightly ajar, customs tags dangling like an invitation—or a trap. It was a risky choice — locking himself inside a shipping container was as close to a tomb as he could imagine. They could only be opened from the outside. If it didn’t open in time...

*I’ve got no choice*

Sliding through the narrow opening, he pulled the heavy doors shut, leaving only a thin crack of light. The darkness within was nearly absolute, a suffocating void pregnant with the ghosts of past journeys. The air hung heavy with the musty scent of wool and linen, overlaid with the faint, lingering perfume of cargoes long past: spices, coffee, and distant lands. He stood for a moment, heart pounding, listening for any sign of pursuit. Then, slowly, he began to feel his way forward, his hands brushing against rough bolts of fabric that lay stacked in the darkness. He found an end and unspooled it, the coarse wool scratching against his skin as he wrapped it around himself. He collapsed onto the floor, the unforgiving steel beneath his layer of wool a cruel reminder of his predicament. It bit into his icy flesh, drawing a hiss of pain through chattering teeth. But he was alive... for now.

He jerked awake, heart pounding. He'd fallen asleep. The realization sent a wave of fear through him.

*No! I can't be this careless!*

To be trapped here, without food or water... it was a slow, agonizing death. If this was his plan, he would *need* to be prepared. Ocean journeys took weeks, sometimes a month or more. The most he could make it without water was a few days. Outside, he heard dockworkers laugh and joke about a meeting — spotkanie wszystkich rąk na pokład — an all-hands meeting. Their laughter faded as a supervisor's voice rose above the others. 

"Get to this damned safety meeting and get back here. We need all of this loaded by dawn. Ship sails at 1100 hours," the man barked. 

Snippets of conversation drifted through the night: complaints about delays, whispers about payoffs to customs agents. Stanislav pressed himself deeper into the shadows, feeling exposed and vulnerable.

He snuck to the door, a sliver of icy air hitting his face as he peered out. He had to find water, food...if this was to be his plan. He knew these containers, knew they could be shipped anywhere. He could be locked in this metal box for weeks, crossing the sea... or worse, an ocean. The thought made his stomach clench. He had to get out there, had to find supplies.

*If I'm not prepared, this will become my metal mausoleum*

Panic swelled within him, a suffocating wave. He envisioned the heavy doors slamming shut, the locks clicking into place, sealing him in this metal coffin. No way out. No food, no water, no escape. The plan that formed in his head was insane, even for him. He had to be sure. He had to survive.

Staying low, he opened the container door and slipped outside. He would have to search.

He walked around for several minutes before the personnel shack caught his eye: a squat, windowed structure with a rack of 20-liter water bottles against the wall. Through the glass, he saw lockers and brightly colored lunch boxes. After checking for watchers, he approached. 

He pushed the door open, wincing at the loud creak it made in the stillness.  The air inside was warm and humid, heavy with the aroma of stale coffee and microwaved meals. Stanislav moved quickly. He loaded a water bottle onto a hand truck, the rubber wheels squeaking as he added the weight. Lunch boxes went next, their cheerful colors stark against the gloom. A yellow raincoat caught his eye, and he shrugged it on to blend in. Then, he grabbed a first aid kit off the wall and a thick package of napkins from the shelf. 

*I'll probably need all of this — maybe more.*

Then he started his way back to the container. A distant voice barked orders, and the rhythmic alarm of a reversing forklift pierced the air. He froze, heart hammering.

*Their meeting must be over.*

He was out of time.

Each creak of the wheels sounded like an alarm to his ears, but he still walked back at an unhurried pace. His heart hammered in his chest as he glanced over his shoulder—no one there. When he reached the container, he slipped inside and closed the doors to a crack behind him. Stanislav stumbled into the container, hauling the hand cart in behind him. He sank onto the bolts of cloth, his legs unable to hold him any longer. His lungs burned, each breath a struggle. He let the hand truck roll to a stop. He lay there, shivering, the taste of fear still thick in his throat.

 His teeth chattered, his body convulsing with cold as he stashed the water bottle and lunch pails amongst the bolts of cloth. He frantically peeled off his soaked clothes, the icy fabric clinging to his skin like a second skin. His numb fingers fumbled with the buttons, each movement an agonizing effort.  The rough wool scratched against his skin, but it was a welcome relief from the icy dampness. Naked, he climbed into the pile of rolled cloth, unspooling a length of wool to wrap around himself. The course material bit into his skin, but it was warm—warm enough to keep him alive.

Every minute stretched into an eternity as he waited before he heard the doors clang shut, the bolt rattling into place with a finality that chilled him to the bone. In the confined space, the metallic thud of the latch echoed like a death knell, sealing his fate if everything didn't go as planned. Suddenly, he was trapped, truly trapped. He clenched his jaw, pushing the thought aside. There was no room for doubt. He had water, food, warmth — just enough to survive if everything went right. 

*Better to die here than let Krov i Lyod get me.*

He opened a lunch pail, the smell of bread and cheese filling his nose. He bit off a morsel, chewing slowly before swallowing. He needed to sort the food in terms of what would spoil sooner, and later. Each bite needed to be a calculation. How long would this last? How long could he make it stretch? He pushed the thought away. He couldn't fail. If he did, he’d die in the dark, another ghost haunting this miserable world. 

The steel walls closed in, a suffocating embrace that threatened to crush him. His metal prison amplified the sound of each breath, a cruel reminder of his pitiful lack of supplies. What if the container remained unopened? What if the confinement stretched on for days...weeks...months, sealed up and forgotten in some dusty warehouse? There would be no way to survive that. Panic swelled, hot and suffocating. 

*I can't die like that* 

He forced it down, clinging to a desperate hope.

*What choice do I have?*

Time crawled. In the darkness, Stanislav strained to catch any sound. Then, with a metallic thunk, the crane's clamps seized the container. The walls creaked and groaned as it was lifted, swaying precariously. Stanislav held his breath, his stomach lurching. There was a dull scrape and thud as it settled into place somewhere on the ship, followed later by the thump and rumble of other containers stacked above.

Oppressive and unyielding, the steel surrounded him—a prison with no escape. Against the cold metal, he pressed his ear, straining to catch any hint of the outside world. The muffled thrum of the ship's engine vibrated through the container, a low, rhythmic pulse that echoed the frantic beat of his own heart. The engine thrummed beneath him, a steady vibration that resonated through the steel.  He was moving. Away from Gdańsk, away from everything he knew.  Towards an uncertain future. Where was this ship taking him? Would he be able to escape when it arrived? And what would he do then, a fugitive with nothing but the clothes on his back? One thing was certain: he had to be ready for whatever awaited him on the other side.

He squeezed his eyes shut, but the image remained: Svetlana's face, a mask of terror, her emerald eyes wide with fear as the murky water swallowed her whole. Her hand, reaching for him, grasping at empty space. He pressed his face into the wool fabric, fighting back the tears that threatened to spill.

Like a venomous serpent, guilt coiled around his heart, choking the breath from his lungs. He'd failed her. He hadn't been strong enough, fast enough. Her final moments, those pleading eyes, would be forever seared into his memory.

*Why did you drag me into this? Why couldn't you have just left me alone, Svetlana?*

He'd survived...for now. But this was only the beginning. Krov i Lyod wouldn't give up so easily. Their reach was long, their vengeance relentless. If they even suspected he was alive, they would hunt him to the ends of the earth, across oceans and continents, until his blood stained their hands. He had to disappear completely. He had to become a ghost, a whisper in the wind, a shadow in the night.
