The Vesper Mixfactory’s holographic sign buzzed faintly, its violet glow slicing distorted shadows onto the slick pavement. Stanislav lingered for a moment beneath the overhang, taking in the scene through the glass doors. Inside, the atmosphere was electric—an eclectic fusion of timeless sophistication and cutting-edge modernity.
Tango jazz swirled through the air, its rhythm a hypnotic undercurrent to the chatter and laughter of patrons. The dance floor at the center was alive with elegance: women in bejeweled, flowing dresses twirled gracefully, their partners clad in sharply tailored suits that harkened back to a more refined era.
Around the perimeter, cocktail tables sat bathed in soft pools of light. Well-dressed couples and solitary figures sipped on cocktails in hues of amber and garnet, their faces half-lit in the ambient glow. Against the far wall, a polished mahogany bar gleamed under pendant lights, where veteran mixologists performed their craft with practiced flair.
But the charm and glamour had its undercurrent. Stanislav’s sharp eyes caught the hulking figures that loitered near the edges of the space: Krov i Lyod enforcers, their crew cuts and ill-fitting suits stretched over cybernetic musculature. Their eyes scanned the room with the cold efficiency of predators, hands twitching slightly too close to their concealed weapons. They stood out like wolves among lambs.
Stanislav stepped inside, the cool air of the Mixfactory wrapping around him. The blue and purple tones of the decor created an otherworldly ambiance, while the ceiling's cupola dome, painted with midnight murals of iconic jazz musicians, loomed overhead like a celestial map.
A host in a crisp black suit intercepted him almost immediately, his polite smile faltering just slightly when Stanislav gave the name.
"Ah...Mr. Horatiu’s associate," the host said, his eyes narrowing ever so briefly. "Your party is waiting upstairs. Far-left balcony, above the bar."
He gestured with a gloved hand toward the wide staircase that curved up to the second level. "I’ll send a server to take your order."
Stanislav inclined his head, his expression impassive, and followed the gesture. Each step up the staircase felt deliberate, his boots barely making a sound against the polished wood. He could feel the weight of eyes on him—patrons glancing curiously, the enforcers studying him with suspicion—but he didn’t falter.
Reaching the balcony, he paused to take in the view. From here, the dance floor stretched out like a painting, the dancers moving in synchronized patterns, their reflections glinting off the mirrored floor. The bar’s rich mahogany surface gleamed below, the clink of glassware a counterpoint to the sultry jazz.
At the far end of the balcony, a small table awaited, set for two. A single figure sat there, her back to the railing.

***

Stanislav strode to the far-left table on the balcony, his steps deliberate but wary. As he neared, the woman turned, a cascade of fiery red hair framing her face.  Her emerald eyes, sharp and mischievous, met his with a smile that didn't quite reach them.
"Svetlana," he said, his tone flat, though his pulse quickened with a mix of wariness and reluctant attraction. "What am I doing here? What kind of trouble are you trying to drag me into this time?"
She gestured to the chair opposite her, the intricate mechanisms of her cybernetic arms whirring softly as she moved. Tiny gears and levers, more for art than function, spun beneath the silver casing, each motion precise and mesmerizing.
"Sit, Stanislav," she said, her voice low and rich, with the faintest hint of a purr. "Let's chat."
Stanislav's eyes met Svetlana's, a silent battle of wills playing out in the dimly lit space. He held her gaze for a long moment, his jaw clenched, before finally easing into the chair. Svetlana was dressed in a deep emerald gown that clung to her curves before cascading into a floor-length train. The jade cigarette holder in her hand was as sleek and refined as she was, a dangerous beauty in a world of shadows and secrets.
With practiced elegance, she slid a cigarette into her jade holder.
Stanislav hesitated for a moment, then accepted the offered cigarette. He struck a match, the faint sulfur scent mixing with the bar's ambient aroma of liquor and polished wood. He held the flame steady, and Svetlana leaned forward, her lips barely brushing the holder as she lit the cigarette.
She inhaled, the tip a glowing ember. A soft laugh escaped her.
"Didn't expect to see you here," she said, amusement and something sharper lacing her tone.
"Horatiu asked nicely," Stanislav said as if that were enough. He dropped the spent match into the ashtray.
"Does he have that much power over you?" Svetlana asked, her lips curling as she exhaled a curl of smoke.
"He doesn't," he replied, his tone neutral, his eyes wary. "But I was curious."
Svetlana nodded.
"Svetlana, what's the real reason I'm here?"
Svetlana tilted her head, her hair catching the purple-tinted light from the dome above. Her emerald eyes met his, a flicker of vulnerability in their depths.
"Let's just say," she said, her voice dropping to a whisper, "I'm in a bit of a predicament. I need some help."
"And Horatiu thought I'd be the solution," Stanislav continued, an eyebrow arching as he stared at Svetlana. 
"I might have mentioned your name," Svetlana shrugged with a single shoulder, one edge of her mouth curling upward in a grin.
Stanislav inhaled sharply, his eyes fixed on Svetlana.
"We were tight once, Stan," Svetlana explained.
"The last time I saw you, you stole fifty thousand holos from me and left me with a mess to clean up," Stanislav growled.
"Pocket change," Svetlana explained, taking another drag. "What's a few holocreds between friends?"
Stanislav scowled.
"Fifty thou isn’t pocket change, Lana," Stanislav growled. "What’s the predicament?"
Svetlana exhaled, a cloud of blue-white smoke obscuring her expression for a moment. 
"Missing data package," she said, her voice carefully casual. "And a client who isn't known for their patience. They want it. I need to find it and then deliver it." 
A chill ran down Stanislav's spine. This was more than a simple retrieval.
"And where do I fit in this?" he asked, crossing his arms. 
That was the moment Elżbieta stepped onto the balcony.
Svetlana's gaze snapped towards the tall, dark-headed woman, locking on with the intensity of a viper about to strike. Her emerald eyes burned with pure venom, a silent promise of retribution. Elżbieta met the stare with a chilling laugh, a sound devoid of any warmth or amusement.
"Svetlana," Elżbieta's voice cracked the greeting like a whip, cutting through the tense silence. Then her gaze shifted to Stanislav, who kept his expression neutral. She took a breath, and some of the irritation bled away from her eyes. "I'm so glad you came, Stanislav. It seems your friend has gotten herself into quite the situation and needs your help."
Svetlana's face hardened, her emerald eyes blazing with defiance. The air thrummed with tension, the unspoken animosity between them a palpable force.
"I don't need Stanislav's help," Svetlana spat, her voice sharp as shattered glass. Elżbieta’s laughter echoed through the bar, chilling him to the bone. She closed the distance between them, her heels clicking on the floor.
"You misunderstand your position, Svetlana," Elżbieta said, her grin toothy.
Svetlana leaned back in her chair, the picture of nonchalance. She took a slow drag from her cigarette, exhaling a plume of smoke that momentarily veiled her face. 
"I misunderstand nothing," she said, her voice calm.
Elżbieta's eyebrows raised. She turned to Stanislav, completely ignoring Svetlana.
"Oh, well, perhaps the fault is mine, Svetlana? I'll let you handle it," Elżbieta chuckled menacingly. She looked at Stanislav. "Join me downstairs for a drink, then, Stan. Svetlana will be quite busy and will likely be poor company."
Elżbieta turned and began walking back toward the stairwell. Svetlana inhaled.
"I never said I didn't need Stanislav's help, Elżbieta," she hissed, removing her spent cigarette from the jade holder and dropping it into the ashtray. She opened the silver case and withdrew another. 
"I'm done dealing with you," Elżbieta hissed, not breaking her stride. She began descending the stairwell.
Stanislav stood, determined to follow Elżbieta. His gut feeling warned him to get out now, while he still could.
"Stan," Svetlana hissed. She waved for him to approach. 
Stanislav shook his head, following closely behind Elżbieta.
"Please, Stan," she whispered, her eyes pleading. Stanislav gritted his teeth.
Keep walking. This isn't your mess
"Please!" she hissed. "I need help!"
Stanislav should have kept walking. Should have left her to drown in her mess. But the history between them was a hook, deep and barbed, and it pulled him back before he could resist.
"Alright, Lana," he said, his voice rough. He walked back to the table, each step a battle against his better judgment. Sinking into the chair, he couldn't shake the feeling that this was a trap.
Svetlana's lips curved into a bright smile, but it was brittle, like glass stretched too thin. Her green eyes flickered with gratitude, but a shadow lingered in their depths. She adjusted her silk scarf unnecessarily, her fingers trembling as they smoothed the fabric against her collarbone.
"I really don’t think it’s all that bad," she said with a forced shrug, her voice too light, too casual. Her gaze darted past his face, skimming over his shoulder as though searching for an escape hatch.
Stanislav raised an eyebrow, unimpressed. 
"I think I should be the judge of that. So go on and tell me, what am I supposed to be helping you with?"
Svetlana flagged down a server, her fingers trembling slightly as she ordered a martini. The server glanced at Stanislav, and he nodded to make it two.
She leaned forward as if to bridge the gulf between them, her hand drifting hesitantly onto his. The movement was slow, almost mechanical, as though she'd had to force herself past some invisible barrier.
"I don’t want this to be just an ugly business arrangement, Stan. We used to be good friends." Her voice softened, almost breaking. "So tell me, how have you been?"
Her smile was brittle, forced. Her eyes flicked to his, pleading, desperate.
Stanislav gently withdrew his hand, his touch impersonal. He met her gaze with a flicker of pity, patted the back of her hand before sitting back in his chair.
The waiter arrived with their drinks. Stanislav placed Svetlana's martini in front of her, then his own, his movements measured.
“You’ve burned a lot of bridges in this town, Lana,” he said, his voice low, almost a murmur, though it cut through the din of the restaurant like a blade. “You must be scraping the bottom of the barrel to come to me.”
Svetlana’s lips twitched, and she adjusted her scarf, a nervous gesture. She stared at him, her usual confidence faltering.
“It doesn’t have to be like that, Stan,” she said finally, her voice a thin thread that wavered on the last word. She sighed, her eyes pleading.
Stanislav’s lips quirked at the corner, but it wasn’t a smile. He lifted his glass and took a measured sip, his expression unreadable as the cool, briny tang of the martini slid across his tongue. He let the silence stretch out between them, heavy and oppressive, before setting the glass down with a deliberate clink.
“It does,” he said flatly, his tone devoid of warmth. His eyes never left hers, and for a moment, he let the weight of his words hang in the air. “Betrayal is a stain that doesn’t wash away or fade with time.”
Svetlana flinched, just barely, but enough for him to notice. Her hand moved instinctively toward the martini, but she stopped short, her fingers hovering over the rim of the glass as though she were unsure whether to drink or retreat. The faint hum of the restaurant’s background chatter seemed to grow louder, pressing in on them, but neither of them looked away.
“I know what I did, Stan,” she said finally, her voice raw, a crack splitting the polished veneer she usually wore like armor. Her gaze dropped to her lap, the weight of his stare too much to bear. “I know I don’t deserve—”
“Don’t waste your breath,” Stanislav said, cutting her off with a wave of his hand. “I didn’t sit down to hear apologies.”
He leaned forward slightly, his elbows resting on the table, the shadows playing across his face making his expression even harder to read. 
“You want help, Lana? Fine. But let’s not dress this up as something it’s not. You’re not here to catch up, and I’m not here to forgive you.”
Her cheeks flushed, and she forced a shaky smile. Her fingers trembled, barely steadying the glass. For the first time, she looked breakable—like glass herself. She took a quick sip and stared past him, her composure shattered. Moments later, she met his gaze again, her green eyes bright. When she spoke, her voice was quiet but determined.
“Then let’s call it what it is,” she said, setting the glass down with a deliberate motion. Her fingers stayed wrapped around it, gripping it like a lifeline. “Business. But don’t think for a second that I don’t regret how things ended, Stan. Because I do.”
Stanislav studied her, battling skepticism with curiosity. After finishing his martini, he delicately clinked the glass back onto the tabletop.
“Regret doesn’t change much,” he said, his tone as cold as the martini he’d just finished. “But go on, tell me what you need before someone else does.”
Svetlana hesitated, her fingers tightening around her glass. She met his gaze, then looked away, lost in thought.
“When you’re a young woman,” she began, her voice soft, almost wistful, “and you’re floating around powerful men like a butterfly in their orbit, it feels like you can get away with anything. That rules don’t apply to you, not the way they do to men. It's an intoxicating feeling.”
Her lips pressed together, weighing each word before she said it. 
“I’ll admit it—I was ambitious. I wanted to play at the same stakes as the men, to prove I could hold my own in their world. Staying in my lane?” She shook her head, her laugh bitter and short. “That was never something I wanted to do.”
Stanislav’s expression didn’t change, his eyes sharp and unreadable as he watched her.
“Somehow,” she continued, her voice dropping, “I thought I was untouchable. All my life I've watched men destroy each other over mistakes—the tiniest of betrayals—but I thought it wouldn’t happen to me. Looks...charm—I thought they would save me. I was wrong.” 
She swallowed hard, her fingers gripping the glass. 
“Turns out, at a certain level, consequences stick to everyone.”
Her shoulders slumped, but her gaze stayed firm.
"Stanislav," she said, her voice quiet but steady, "I know this is a strange way of saying I’m sorry, but I am. I was stupid and wrong. And now…" 
Her voice caught for just a moment, and she took a sharp breath to steady herself. 
"...now I’m alone and I'm in trouble."
She didn’t cry—Svetlana wasn’t the type to cry—but the cracks in her facade were impossible to miss. It wasn’t the grand apology Stanislav might have expected. It was raw, unpolished, and clumsy, but it was real.
Stanislav leaned back, impassive. He reached for his martini, took a slow sip, savoring it like a man with all the time in the world. The glass clinked softly as he set it down, breaking the silence.
“The more you delay telling me what kind of trouble you’re in,” he said, his voice calm but edged with steel, “the worse I’m going to think it is, Lana. Out with it. This is too many words, especially for you.”
Svetlana nodded quickly, the movement jerky, almost panicked. She pressed her lips together and inhaled a shaky breath, her shoulders rising and falling with the effort.
“It’s bad, Stan,” she said, her voice trembling.
Stanislav crossed one leg over the other, resting an elbow on the arm of his chair. He arched an eyebrow, his expression shifting into one of faint amusement, though his eyes remained sharp. 
“How bad is bad, Lana? Stop delaying and tell me.”
She shuddered visibly, her head shaking as if trying to physically dispel the weight of her next words. 
“It was just supposed to be a simple delivery,” she began, her voice faltering. “Pick up a package, deliver it somewhere else. Software... two parts. I had the code and the decryption key.”
Stanislav’s calm facade cracked, his eyes widening as the implications hit him. 
“Don’t tell me you lost it.”
Svetlana offered a sheepish shrug, her lips pulling into a grimace. 
"I was jumped," she admitted, her voice breaking slightly. "It had to be somebody who knew. Anyway... they took the decryption key."
Stanislav’s fingers drummed once against the table, his gaze narrowing like a predator scenting blood. 
"And without the key?" he asked, already knowing the answer.
"It’s useless," she finished, her voice barely above a whisper. "The software can’t be decrypted without it."
She slumped back in her chair, rubbing her forehead with one hand as though trying to block out her own words. The tension in her posture, the way her shoulders hunched forward, spoke volumes. For once, Svetlana didn’t try to gloss over the gravity of her situation.
Stanislav’s breath hissed out, his knuckles white as he gripped the table’s edge. His eyes locked on hers, unblinking. 
"Alright, Lana, tell me everything...right now...or I'm walking out of here. What does this little piece of tech do?" he asked.
Svetlana hesitated, her fingers tracing the rim of her glass as though searching for courage. 
"It’s a SCALPEL script," she admitted, her voice low. "A backdoor to a person's Stella private-net construct. Don’t ask me how it works—you don't ask those kind of questions.”
"Slice into personal Stella code?" Stanislav asked, frowning. He leaned back, his hand tapping lightly against his martini glass, not liking what he heard. This was dangerous ground. "What does that even mean? What does it open?"
“I said I don’t know everything,” Svetlana admitted, her voice dropping. “But...a lot. Security layers. Personal data. Maybe even biometric overrides. Whatever it is, it’s definitely not legal.”
Stanislav’s brow furrowed, his fingers tightening around the stem of his glass. 
“You were carrying a backdoor for Stella? A skeleton key for rewriting at least some parts of one's existence?”
"I didn’t ask. They didn’t explain. It was better that way," she admitted, shrugging. "I figured the less I knew, the better."
“Generally, yes. But, Svetlana, does this kind of thing even have a price?” Stanislav asked, his voice sharpening.
Svetlana shifted in her seat, her hands tightening on the glass. She shrugged
Stanislav froze, his eyes narrowing.
"Millions?" he asked
"Tens of millions...maybe more," she added, barely audible. "Probably more."
He let out a bitter laugh, shaking his head. 
"And you just...lost it? Come on, Svetlana."
"I didn’t let them, Stan," Svetlana muttered, defensive and tight. "They overpowered me. What was I supposed to do?"
Stanislav exhaled sharply, rubbing his temples, knowing the thieves would have been far less cruel if they had taken her life, too. 
Ship's sailed, Stan, deal with what we have
“What kind of encryption was on it?” he asked after a moment of thought.
“Something top-shelf, Metrofederacy grade,” Svetlana answered quickly. “It’s split in two. Code and decryption key. Without the key, the software’s useless.”
“And you lost the key,” Stanislav said flatly.
“I was jumped, Stan. Somebody must’ve known what I had,” Svetlana explained, wincing. 
Stanislav leaned back, staring at her like she’d just told him she’d stolen a bomb and misplaced the detonator. 
"Let me get this straight. You were walking around with something worth tens of millions, maybe more, and you lost it? And they didn’t kill you on the spot?"
"No, Stan, I'm supposed to go get it back. That’s why you're here, Stan. I need your help," she admitted, shoulders sagging.
Stanislav let out a low chuckle, though there was no humor in it. A nasty suspicious was forming a tickle between his shoulder blades.
"They don't send couriers out to fix their screw-ups, Lana," he said.
"Maybe they do this time," Svetlana countered. "Quit trying to make this into something worse than it already is."
"It is worse than it already is, Lana. This isn’t a favor...it’s a miracle you’re asking for. And this trouble you're in...it's not the kind that goes away, Lana," he said. "Someone is going to have to wear this."
Stanislav leaned forward, his elbows resting on the table, as Svetlana’s story unfolded. But the more she spoke, the more ridiculous it sounded. It was too ridiculous. His mind was already picking at the loose threads. A skeleton key for the Stella Constructor? An all-access backdoor to a system designed by an AI smarter than every human alive put together? It was nonsense. Snake oil. Fairytale-grade unobtainium. His lips curled in a faint, humorless smile. He needed to tread cautiously.
“Lana,” he said, his voice carefully neutral, “if this thing is worth tens of millions and can do everything you say, why would they give it to a third-party courier to deliver? Why not lock it down in a vault somewhere? Move it through their own channels?”
Svetlana blinked, her brow furrowing slightly.
“I—I don’t know,” she admitted, stumbling over the words. “Maybe they thought it would draw less attention this way? I I don't know why they picked me, Stan. They didn’t tell me much, just to take it, follow the route, and keep my mouth shut.”
"I'm getting a real bad feeling, Lana," Stanislav said, frowning. 
"What?" Svetlana hissed. "You know I hate your bad feelings, Stan."
For a moment, Stanislav just sat and massaged his temples, trying to piece it together in his mind.
"What if the software never worked?" Stanislav asked, raising his eyes to meet Svetlana's.
Svetlana shrugged.
"How could I know that? I was just supposed to deliver it," she said, scowling. She took another cigarette from the case and inserted it into the jade holder.
"I'm guessing here, but if they found out their expensive new software toy didn't actually work, someone's neck is already in a noose," Stanislav mused, stroking his chin in thought.
"I don't like it when you guess," Svetlana frowned.
"If some Krov i Lyod underboss got shafted for tens of millions of holos over a stupid software phishing scam..." Stanislav lifted his martini glass and in one gulp, finished it. "Where is the software now, Lana."
Svetlana's eyes darted around the room, her hands clenching into fists. With a shaky breath, she reached into her clutch. Stanislav tensed, his eyes narrowing, but she didn’t pull out a weapon. Instead, she produced a dull metal datachip, small enough to disappear into the palm of her hand.
"All this trouble," she murmured, her voice barely a whisper.  She carefully placed the datachip on the table between them. It was dull metal, smaller than his thumbnail. "For something so small."
Stanislav froze. The chip on the table was impossibly small for the chaos it promised—just laying there like a coiled viper in a pot of petunias. This wasn’t just a hypothetical mess—this was real. He’d thought she was just the scapegoat, someone the Krov i Lyod had set up to take the fall. But if Svetlana still had the software...
He leaned in, his voice dropping to a harsh whisper. 
"Wait, you're saying they didn't search you? They let you keep it?" Stanislav whispered, eyes tightening to slits.
"They never asked for it," Svetlana said, shrugging. "I figured without the key, they would have thought it was worthless."
Stanislav's mind raced. If Svetlana was still holding the package, that meant Krov i Lyod had already tried everything imaginable to make it work and failed. They'd bought junk, knew it was junk...but the holos were gone, seller was a ghost, and now needed to shift the blame. They weren't even concerned about getting it back.
"They set you up, Lana," Stanislav frowned, his eyes fixed on the chip like it might detonate at any moment. "My guess is they're going to want you...and now me...to take a long nap. I don't know how much time we have."
Suddenly, Svetlana's pupils flared. She was angry.
"And you’re here to make it all look clean, right?" Svetlana spat, her anger flaring. "Just killing a woman alone is bad optics. Add a man who should’ve known better, and they've got themselves a perfect story. Fuckers."
Stanislav shrugged in surrender, not knowing what to say.
"Think we're going to be able to walk out of here?" Svetlana asked.
Stanislav’s lips twitched, faint amusement ghosting across his face. 
"I wouldn't trust the front door," he said, his tone casual. He was amazed he was this calm. 
"There's an office with a fire escape," Svetlana said, shrugging. She took a deep breath, her gaze hardening. Stanislav nodded.
"Let's take the time to plan while we have it," Stanislav sighed, shaking his head. He looked at Svetlana, who shrank under his gaze. For once, her defiance was gone. "We need to get out of town for at least a couple of days until we learn what's really happening. If it calms down, we come back and deal with this. If it goes the other way, we get clear and find somewhere to hole up, new identities, new lives."
“I’m so sorry,” she said, her voice cracking—raw and uneven. “I swear to you, Stan, I had no idea it would end like this. No idea.”
Stanislav's gaze bored into her, his expression unreadable. He shook his head, his voice sharp as broken glass.
"Bad decisions don’t come with labels, Lana. If they did, no one would make them. Now let’s get moving before this one blows up in our faces and we don't have any choices left."
