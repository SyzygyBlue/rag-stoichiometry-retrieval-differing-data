    "full_scene_clean": "Chase awoke with a terrible headache on a hard metal bed with a woven reed mat in a tiny brick-and-timber room that smelled of wood smoke and sewage. A 10 cm square hole let in dim light. His clothes had been replaced with roughspun brown shirt and trousers. He whispered and heard Quincy through the wall on straw. She accused him of scheming; he replied he was locked up too. They assessed their captors: not bandits, slavers, or ravagers—too well-armed, armored, and coordinated—more like mercenaries hired by someone with money to take them alive and stow them “off the board.” When Chase mentioned he’d injected funds into her arm during the ambush, Quincy demanded the amount; he admitted 100,000 holocreds. She panicked about someone cutting off her arm to get the chip. They agreed to focus on escape. Quincy began searching for a way to open her lock, lamenting the loss of her toolbox; Chase searched his cell as well.",
    "dense_recap_250w": "Chase regains consciousness in a cramped, foul-smelling brick cell outfitted with a metal bed, reed mat, chair, bucket, and a fold-down shelf. Dressed in rough prison garb and barefoot, he calls out and makes contact with Quincy through the wall. They quickly rule out common raiders or slavers as their abductors, concluding that a highly trained, well-equipped team—likely mercenaries hired by a wealthy patron—captured them alive. The motive they infer is to remove them from play for later use, not to kill them. Chase reveals he used an injector during the ambush to implant a holocred chip into Quincy for her benefit. When he admits the amount—one hundred thousand holocreds—Quincy erupts, fearing the chip will make her a target for mutilation. Despite tension and accusations, they align on the immediate goal: escape. Quincy starts searching for improvised tools to pick or defeat the lock, wishing for her toolbox, while Chase commits to scouring his bare cell. The scene cements their captivity, clarifies the professionalism and resources of the enemy, exposes a new risk associated with the implanted funds, and pivots both characters from shock to problem-solving under pressure.",
