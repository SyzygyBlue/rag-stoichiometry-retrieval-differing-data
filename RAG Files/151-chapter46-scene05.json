    "full_scene_clean": "Marcus Jessop\nHow could he ever be Brother Jessop again.\n\"We didn't have to murder everyone!\" Marcus cried, looking up from his knees at the cross-armed form of the warlord ravager Makko.\n\"Good God, Marcus. Yes, we did,\" Makko sneered. \"We took millions of Metrofederacy holos. Perfect anonymity was a non-negotiable condition. We're building an army with that money, Marcus.\"\n\"You didn't need to kill Fox River!\" Marcus groaned.\nMakko jabbed a finger at Marcus. \"I didn't do that. You did. Because you failed—every step of the way. The caravanner girl, the skerv, the church girl... You let them live. You let all of them live! Margdelain got our records. Our records, Marcus, the ones you kept so meticulously, like an idiot.\"\n\"Margdelain—who was this close to brokering Fox River joining the Metrofederacy. The same Metrofederacy our client is a part of. The same client who insists on anonymity. You're a disaster. Make no mistake, Fox River is all your fault. If it weren't for your relationship with the client, you would already be dead.\"\nHe turned away, disgust twisting his features. \"The only thing you didn't personally fuck up was Dinh Tam not killing the caravan girl. His daughter wanted Margdelain's boy. I told him, begged him to kill that caravanner bitch. I warned him! He said it was handled. Said Margdelain's boy had some loyalty to the girl, said if they killed her too soon, it would be a problem. He swore they had it handled. In the end, I had to burn the whole fucking place down with Margdelain's boy and the Caravanner in it. That's how you get shit done.\"\nMakko sneered and spat on the ground. He clamped his hand around Marcus's chin. \"What choice did I have, Marcus? We made a deal. I had to wipe them both out. Fox River. The holdfast. All of it.\"\nMarcus whimpered.\n\"Goddammit, power is expensive, Marcus,\" Makko growled, releasing him. \"Power and altruism rarely mix... you need to understand that. You can't accomplish the sorts of things you have planned without a few people getting hurt. Hurt them and worry about sainthood later. After we win, rewrite history however you want.\"\n\"But know this: I had to take powerful assets off the table today because you failed to act. Next time this happens, I will kill you. Never fail this bad again, Marcus. You won't survive.\"\nThe heavy door slammed shut, leaving Marcus alone. He collapsed, tears mingling with the dust on the floor. Was this the path God intended? Must he become a monster to build His kingdom?\nYet a spark ignited within him. His vision was righteous; the world needed salvation, even if the cost was steep. Makko's threat hung heavy, but Marcus would not falter. He would become the instrument of change, no matter the cost. With a resolute breath, Marcus rose, wiping tears away, determination hardening. The world of God would rise from the ashes, and he would be its architect, savior, even martyr if need be.",
    "dense_recap_250w": "In a closed-door confrontation, ravager warlord Makko berates Marcus Jessop (formerly Brother Jessop) for operational failures that exposed their anonymous Metrofederacy client and jeopardized a covert plan funded by “millions of Metrofederacy holos.” Makko accuses Marcus of allowing key targets—the caravanner girl, the skerv, and the church girl—to live, and of keeping meticulous records that Margdelain accessed while negotiating Fox River’s entry into the Metrofederacy. To preserve client anonymity and remove “powerful assets,” Makko claims he was forced to destroy Fox River and the Calum-Tam holdfast, blaming Marcus’s indecision and Dinh Tam’s refusal to kill the caravanner because his daughter wanted Margdelain’s son alive. Makko threatens to kill Marcus if he fails again. Alone, Marcus breaks down but then hardens: wrestling with faith and morality, he resolves to embrace ruthless means for what he believes is a righteous, God-driven vision. The scene establishes the funding source, the secrecy requirement, internal blame for mass casualties, and Marcus’s turn toward uncompromising zeal, escalating the conflict between ideological justification and atrocities committed in its name.",
