    "full_scene_clean": "They stop in a rocky ravine long enough to hook their second-best battery to the rooftop solar panel and catch the last sunlight. After two hours of driving—about sixty kilometers from the ravager camp—there is no visible pursuit, but the flats offer little cover. Quincy prepares to reconnect the buggy’s final motor phase, estimating 45 minutes if smooth or up to four hours if rewinding coils is required; if it’s irreparable they will limp toward Broken Bow at reduced performance. Demmy worries about being spotted and keeps watch from a shale-and-sandstone outcrop. He points out a far-off dust cloud to the east—likely a vehicle some 30 km away—reinforcing their need for speed and concealment. Quincy explains that running without the fix will drain batteries faster and keep them slow and catchable. She finishes tidying and reconnecting wiring; with a last twist of the wrench, the cart is ready to roll. The distant dust plume appears to be moving away as they steer the two-seater back onto the track. Demmy keeps glancing back, the thin smear of dust on the horizon a constant reminder of danger across the open plains.",
    "dense_recap_250w": "Quincy and Demmy pause in a shallow ravine after two hours and roughly sixty kilometers of travel from the ravager camp. They mount their second-best battery to the roof’s solar panel to sip the day’s last light while Quincy opens her toolbox to address the buggy’s lingering powertrain fault: a disconnected or failed phase on the electric motor. She estimates a best-case fix of forty-five minutes, or four hours if she must redo windings, noting that leaving it unfixed will increase system stress and accelerate battery drain—keeping them slow and vulnerable. Demmy takes a lookout position on the shale-sandstone ridge and spots a distant dust plume to the east, perhaps thirty kilometers away. The landscape is too flat to hide in, so they need to regain speed or risk being easy prey. Quincy methodically tidies and reconnects wiring; if the motor is truly toast, they plan to limp toward Broken Bow regardless, but she remains confident she can keep it working. With a final wrench turn the buggy is operational; the distant dust seems to be heading away. They strap in and pull onto the rough track, Demmy checking the horizon as the faint dust line lingers—an ever-present prompt that pursuit or accident could still erase their lead.",
