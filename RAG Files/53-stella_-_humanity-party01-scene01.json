    "full_scene_clean": "In an electromagnetically shielded conference room at the Humanity Party Headquarters above Jinbar Falls, Cervantes Adlawan (Industry Party chair) sat with Romuald Anwar (Teragen CEO) while Giles Montague (Humanity Party chair) arrived. With PIDs dead and no sensors present, they debated the Metrofederacy’s immigration paralysis and the accelerating die-off outside its walls. Adlawan defended slow, risk-averse stewardship of the Stella AI for the sake of two billion citizens; Montague pressed the moral cost—tens of thousands dying daily—and demanded a plan to induct up to a billion new citizens per rules cycle. Romuald argued Stella could not scale safely without vast human behavior auditors to train and supervise models. Montague floated leverage (recreation allowances) and Balance-Party votes, then steered a “thought experiment”: procure ~100,000 culturally diverse human reviewers, but—if they were compulsively motivated via neurochemical ‘neuroject’ hacks (attributed to Li Mei)—fewer might suffice by working sixteen hours daily. Adlawan called it monstrous but admitted it would produce the labor. Montague countered that letting a billion die was worse and hinted at sealing a rule under Article 18 privilege if a Balance executive co-signed. Romuald was aghast; Adlawan warned Balance would crush their SAIRs. Montague insisted the discussion was not hypothetical and that Romuald would implement delivery if it proceeded. The Faraday cage’s secrecy underscored the gravity: they were weighing coercive means to save lives versus preserving ethical and technical order.",
    "dense_recap_250w": "In a Faraday-caged room at Humanity Party HQ, Giles Montague meets Industry Chair Cervantes Adlawan and Teragen CEO Romuald Anwar with Stella communications purposely severed. Montague castigates Industry’s caution for enabling mass death outside the Metrofederacy, arguing for immediate, massive citizenship waves—up to a billion people per rules cycle. Adlawan defends the duty to protect core Stella AI stability for existing citizens, recounting history (attacks spurred by the ‘Eat the Metrofederacy’ slogan and the first civilian collapse) as rationale for restraint. Romuald says scale is limited by the need for many human behavior auditors to supervise and train Stella on diverse cultures and signals. Montague offers political leverage (exotic recreation allowances) and Balance Party defections, then tests a darker ‘thought experiment’: compel wildlanders into auditing by using neurochemical ‘neuroject’ hacks (referencing Li Mei’s work), allowing relentless sixteen-hour shifts to bootstrap Stella until automation improves. Adlawan calls the idea monstrous yet acknowledges its feasibility; Montague argues the real monstrosity is letting millions die. He suggests hiding authorizations under Article 18 privilege, provided a Balance executive signs. Romuald is horrified, while Adlawan doubts Balance would permit it without punitive SAIR consequences. The scene ends with Montague implying the plan is already in motion and that Romuald would be tasked with implementation, laying bare a choice between coercive salvation and ethical governance.",
