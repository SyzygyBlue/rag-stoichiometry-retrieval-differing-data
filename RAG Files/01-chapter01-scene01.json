    "full_scene_clean": "Quincy awakens amid dust, gun smoke, and ringing pain beneath collapsed corrugated metal. A gaunt, wary skerv youth—ragged clothes, blue eyes—signals for silence beside her. Gavin is gone, but his pack remains nearby. The youth hands Quincy Andreu’s cocked .45 automag; memory flashes confirm Andreu’s death during the attack. As distant gunfire and vehicles fade—ravagers pursuing the fleeing Three Shovels Caravan—Quincy fights panic and focuses on slow breathing. She watches the youth use a shard of glass as a mirror to scan their rear. He whispers instructions: stay low, keep moving, don’t stop. With the camp quieting and a thicket of brambles and a far treeline offering cover, they decide to sprint for the brush. Quincy disengages the safety, crawls out, shoulders her pack, and bolts after the youth, expecting fire at any moment.",
    "dense_recap_250w": "In the aftermath of a ravager attack, Quincy regains consciousness pinned beneath rusted sheet metal in a devastated encampment. Disoriented by pain, dust, and the stench of death, she recognizes a silent companion: a gaunt skerv youth who signals for quiet and gives her Andreu’s cocked .45 automag—confirming Andreu was killed earlier in the firefight. Gavin is absent but has left his canvas pack nearby, a reminder of recent betrayal and violence. As the gunfire and engine whine recede—the ravagers likely chasing the escaping Three Shovels Caravan—Quincy struggles against mounting panic, grounding herself through measured breathing. The youth methodically scouts their rear with a palm-sized mirror shard and whispers a simple plan: stay low, keep moving, don’t stop. With the immediate area momentarily still and only open ground between them and a snag of brambles leading to a distant treeline, the pair commit to a dash for concealment. Quincy disengages her pistol’s safety, crawls free, and runs after the youth, bracing for incoming fire. The scene focuses on sensory overload, trauma management, and a survival choice under extreme pressure.",
