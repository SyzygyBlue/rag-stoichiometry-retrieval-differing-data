    "full_scene_clean": "Demmy sits on the edge of a wooden bed in a small cell within the Divine Order of the Sanctifying Flame’s monastery at Fox River. The scents of old books, burnt candles, and likely incense mingle with the quiet. He tests the softness of the pillow and blanket, scarcely believing the comfort after years sleeping under trash in the wildlands. The room contains a two-drawer dresser, a writing table, a chair, two folded gray robes, and sandals. Brothers Ernesto and Olafsen, who brought him from the hospital, wait outside while he changes out of his gown. Demmy places a camera and a datapad into the dresser, covering them with a robe; the datapad is charged but he chooses not to power it on yet. He touches the new scars on his abdomen without emotion, recalling how easily this latest brush with death passed thanks to Fox River’s medicine. Feeling no pain for the first time in memory, he vows never to be a skerv again and decides he will do whatever it takes to belong here. He dresses in the coarse robe, slips on the padded sandals, and steps into the corridor where the brothers smile and invite him to a scripture class. Demmy nods and walks with them through the wood-paneled halls, quietly settling into his decision to blend in and become one of them.",
    "dense_recap_250w": "In a Fox River monastery cell operated by the Divine Order of the Sanctifying Flame, Demmy confronts the unreal comfort of clean bedding, robes, and sandals after years of wildland deprivation. The room is simple—bed, dresser, table, chair—and smells of books and candle smoke, possibly incense. Still in a hospital gown at first, he carefully stores his few possessions: a camera and a fully charged datapad, which he covers with a robe and pointedly does not power on. He examines fresh abdominal scars from surgeries that saved his life after the caravan battle, noting that this near-death experience felt strangely easy compared to past survival ordeals. The absence of pain crystallizes his resolve: he will never be a skerv again. Determined to secure a place inside Fox River’s safety, he decides to do whatever is necessary to blend in with the Order. Brothers Ernesto and Olafsen, patient and kind, step out to let him change; when he emerges robed and sandaled, they invite him to a scripture class. Demmy accepts, walking the monastery’s wood-paneled corridors. The scene closes on his inward commitment to assimilation, the hidden datapad hinting at unfinished business and the moral tension between survival, identity, and sincerity of faith.",
