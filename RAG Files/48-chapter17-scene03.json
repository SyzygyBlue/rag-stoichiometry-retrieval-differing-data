    "full_scene_clean": "A cacophony of applause erupted as Margdelain entered the council chambers, the sound reverberating through the hall. Caught off guard, she hissed into her sublingual mic for answers. Master Scrivener Francis replied through her aural implant: the ovation was for her son, Chase, now being hailed as a hero. She forced a composed smile and moved down the aisle, greeting well-wishers while suspecting Brother Jessop had engineered the moment. Jessop applauded with cool eyes. Councilman Swift praised her wounded hero son; Bivualier looked uneasy. Reaching the Chancellor’s bench beneath the Fox River chimera seal, she brought the council to order with the gavel. Sergeant-at-Arms Billings confirmed quorum. Jessop immediately raised a Point of Privilege and moved to adjourn to honor the wounded hero. The motion was seconded and passed. Margdelain masked her defeat, kept smiling, and quietly ordered Francis to tell McTanner that Chase must remain in the TRG and that no one should know termination was ever considered. She planned to reassess overnight and force another vote when numbers allowed, even as doubt tightened in her stomach.",
    "dense_recap_250w": "Chancellor Margdelain enters the Fox River council chambers to an unexpected standing ovation, quickly learning via sublingual/aural comms with Master Scrivener Francis that the applause is for her son, Chase, who is being celebrated as a wounded hero. Reading the room, she suspects Brother Jessop set the stage to derail her planned vote to open an inquiry into joining the Metrofederacy. While she performs the role of concerned mother and accepts congratulations (notably from Councilman Swift), she notes Councilman Bivualier’s discomfort and pushes to begin proceedings. After Sergeant-at-Arms Billings confirms quorum, Jessop invokes a Point of Privilege and moves to adjourn in order to properly honor the returning hero. The motion is quickly seconded and passes, effectively blocking Margdelain’s vote for the day. Maintaining a public smile, Margdelain sublingually instructs Francis to contact McTanner: under no circumstances may Chase leave the TRG, and no one can learn that removal was considered. She concludes Jessop and conservatives will use the hero narrative to unwind hard-won support (including whatever leverage she had over Bivualier), and she orders her team to reassess and be ready to revote as soon as the numbers can be reassembled. The scene ends with Margdelain outwardly composed but privately furious at being outmaneuvered.",
