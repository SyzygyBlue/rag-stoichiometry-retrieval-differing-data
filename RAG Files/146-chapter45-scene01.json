    "full_scene_clean": "Lesha’s voice tightens as she stares at a drone feed: Fox River isn’t just offline—it’s gone, replaced by fire, wreckage, and a smoking crater. Demmy stiffens. Quincy, driving the TEG-6, presses for clarity. Lesha confirms: the whole city is physically gone. Quincy whispers, trying to grasp the scale. From the back seat, a battered Chase rasps an answer to Lesha’s question: thirteen thousand lived there. Shock settles over the cab. Quincy asks where to go now; Chase jokes bitterly that Fox River is not an option and that Ransom Canyon won’t welcome them. He suggests Broken Bow. Quincy sets the coordinates, turns the last TEG-6 around, and prepares to run redline to get Chase medical help.",
    "dense_recap_250w": "Racing away from the burning Calum-Tam Holdfast in a TEG-6, Quincy, Demmy, and Lesha reel as Lesha, watching a live drone pass, reports that Fox River is not merely dark but physically annihilated—only a crater remains. The revelation stuns the group: Quincy struggles to process the loss, Demmy slumps in shock, and Chase, barely conscious, gives the population figure—thirteen thousand—before admitting he can’t think through the pain. With Fox River destroyed and Ransom Canyon off-limits, Quincy asks for a destination that can treat Chase’s extensive injuries. Chase chooses Broken Bow, the nearest place they consider safe enough and reachable quickly if they push the vehicle. Quincy inputs the route into the nav system and commits to a high-speed run. The scene pivots the party from a rescue exfiltration to refugee triage amid mass-casualty catastrophe, solidifying the immediate goal: keep Chase alive while the geopolitical ground shifts catastrophically under them.",
