    "full_scene_clean": "Jebidiah McTanner gritted his teeth and shoved the microphone back in its holder. \"It's a goddamned nightmare,\" he growled, slamming his fist on the console. \"He left his navigator, Jeb. It's like he's determined to do something stupid,\" Carson muttered. \"Focus on getting there, Carson. Pray to God he's still alive.\" The TEG-6 lurched over rubble, tires clawing for grip as dust billowed behind them. \"The kid's actions have tied up the Tactical Response Group while his mom tries to drag Fox River—kicking and screaming—into the Metrofederacy,\" Carson said. \"Of the two, I'm glad we're dealing with the kid, even if he is off the rails. Maybe things would be different if his mom had been less controlling.\" \"Less controlling? Have you met Chancellor Margdelain?\" McTanner scoffed. \"Chase is a good kid. I half-raised him. He's driven, just like his mother. Every bit of this is him clawing his way out of her shadow. And Margdelain? Shoving him back in.\" \"That boy's got every advantage imaginable,\" Carson growled. \"Why doesn't he use them?\" \"He can't make a move without his mother swooping in. He may have advantages, but he's not free to use them,\" Jeb said. \"If he were a little less stubborn, she'd win. He's as strong-willed as Margdelain, and he's in full rebellion, desperate to be his own man.\" \"Even if it kills him?\" \"I'm afraid so.\" Silence. Then Carson pointed. \"Smoke.\" Jeb saw multiple pencil-thin lines rising and smearing westward. He grabbed the comms mic. \"Contacts, dead ahead. Element leaders, ready gunners. Drivers, fall into single file for a close-in pass. Watch for friendlies. Clear to fire upon confirmation of target.\" The V formation shifted into a single file as the TRG vehicles raced forward. Jeb opened the rifle case, clicking each piece together and sliding on the scope. \"Chase's TEG-2,\" Carson pointed. Jeb nodded, rolling down the window as they crested the hill.",
    "dense_recap_250w": "Riding in a TEG-6, Jebidiah McTanner and his driver Carson push a Tactical Response Group (TRG) convoy toward smoke columns that likely mark the battle where Chase has raced ahead alone. McTanner vents at the situation—Chase abandoned his navigator and may be doing something reckless—but he defends the boy’s motives, framing them as a struggle for independence from Chancellor Margdelain’s control. Carson counters that Chase has every advantage but refuses to use them; McTanner argues those advantages are constrained by Margdelain’s interference. As dust trails the convoy over rubble, Carson spots thin smoke plumes drifting west. McTanner seizes the radio, issues contact and formation orders, and transitions the convoy from a V to single file for a close-in pass with strict friend-or-foe caution before weapons release. He assembles his rifle while Carson identifies Chase’s TEG-2 ahead, confirming they have reached the area. The scene ends with the TRG cresting a hill to enter the engagement zone, McTanner balancing command focus with paternal worry, and political tensions—Fox River’s push toward the Metrofederacy—hanging over the operation.",
