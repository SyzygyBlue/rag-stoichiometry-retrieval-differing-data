    "summary": "Evelyn is a soft-spoken former initiate and student of the Divine Order at the Fox River Monastery. She is kind, nurturing, curious, and quietly courageous, increasingly willing to break rules when love or justice is at stake. Proficiencies noted in her dossier include stealthy navigation of Fox River’s secret tunnels, a knack for configuring a communication device, and strong interpersonal care centered on Demmy. Captured and tortured for withholding information about him, she suffered broken fingers and facial trauma yet refused to speak his name. The fall of Fox River ended her institutional ties and left her disillusioned and displaced, though she retains empathy and hope. By the end of the book, her relationship with Demmy remains intact but burdened by shared trauma. She stands as a symbol of moral clarity under duress and may grow into a larger force later, but here her role is a high-empathy anchor and survivor.",

    "bio_200w": "Evelyn is a former Fox River Monastery initiate of the Divine Order whose dossier highlights quiet courage, empathy, and a growing willingness to act by conscience when love or justice is at stake. She is kind, nurturing, and curious, and she learns the monastery’s secret tunnels well enough to move stealthily. She can configure a communication device and is notably effective at comforting and guiding Demmy. When captured and tortured for information about him, she suffers broken fingers and facial trauma but refuses to speak his name. The destruction of Fox River ends her institutional ties and leaves her disillusioned, yet she retains her warmth and hope. By book’s end she remains bonded to Demmy, though the relationship bears the weight of shared trauma, marking her as a survivor and moral anchor rather than a plot-driving force.",
    "arc_200w": "Evelyn is a rule-bound initiate whose arc shifts from institutional obedience to personal conviction. She begins as an obedient, curious student tasked with helping Demmy adapt to monastery life. As affection grows, she questions doctrine, explores forbidden tunnels, and takes risks to protect him. Her crucible arrives when she is captured and tortured; she endures broken fingers and facial trauma but withholds Demmy’s name, demonstrating a lionhearted defense of someone she loves. The destruction of Fox River severs her from the Divine Order and leaves her an orphaned survivor under an empty sky. Post-pivot, she remains empathetic yet disillusioned, with her compass set toward protecting Demmy and surviving in a world beyond the Order. Future direction is uncertain but centers on rebuilding a life with him and navigating dangers hinted at by his past.",
    "skills_120w": "Evelyn is proficient at stealthy movement and tunnel navigation within Fox River. She shows technical aptitude by easily configuring a communication device for Demmy and demonstrates strong interpersonal skills through calm, empathetic guidance. Her tactical strengths emphasize clandestine movement and comforting others under stress. Documented limitations include naivete shaped by a sheltered upbringing, self-doubt, emotional vulnerability tied to her bond with Demmy, and rule-breaking tendencies that can carry consequences.",
    "appearance_120w": "Evelyn has a soft, youthful Mediterranean look with medium-to-olive complexion, straight shoulder-length brown hair parted down the middle, a slight wave, and light oil for gloss. Her large brown eyes once radiated innocence; post-Fox River they carry guarded grief. A subtle scar on the back of one hand is a reminder of torture. She is petite and agile, moving with grace. Pre-fall she wears cream/beige/ochre Divine Order robes; for stealth she uses muted earth-tones; post-fall she shifts to practical, utilitarian clothing suited for movement and comfort.",
    "relationships_180w": "Evelyn’s central relationship is with Demmy. Their bond grows from classmate/friendship into deep romance, and she risks punishment and torture to protect him, never speaking his name. With Elder Florian, she once had a respectful student/teacher tie that is effectively severed with Fox River’s destruction and her disillusionment. After the fall, she is rescued by Shelly, Alejandro, and Werner; her mention of Demmy helps connect their efforts to persons of interest. Overall, her ties reflect steadfast empathy and loyalty, with love guiding choices even when rules forbid it. These connections frame her as an emotional anchor and survivor whose allegiance has moved from institution to person."
