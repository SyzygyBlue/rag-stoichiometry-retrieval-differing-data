### Character Dossier

**Name:** Romuald Anwar
**MBTI:** INTJ (Analyst - Architect) *Inferred*
**Age:** Late 50s
**Origin:** Unknown
**Occupation:** Senior Engineer/AI Specialist, likely a high-ranking official within the Industry Party
**Affiliations:** Industry Party, Stella Development Directorate, Metrofederacy, CEO of Teragen Development Corporation — primary developer of Stella AI

**Personality:**
- Analytical and Logical: Romuald consistently approaches problems from a technical standpoint, relying on data and logic to form his conclusions.
- Pragmatic and Solution-Oriented:  Despite his initial resistance, he actively seeks solutions to complex problems, even considering radical options.
- Responsible and Dedicated: He feels a strong sense of responsibility for maintaining Stella and the Metrofederacy's stability.
- Stressed and Burdened: The immense pressure of his work and the dire circumstances weigh heavily on him.
- Reluctantly Authoritarian: While not inherently power-seeking, his position and the crisis force him to make difficult decisions and shield his team from the full weight of the situation.

**Appearance:**
- Height: Approximately 178 cm (5'10")
- Build: Lean, slightly stooped from long hours at consoles and desks
- Face: Angular and austere — high cheekbones, a sharp jawline, and deep-set, observant eyes framed by dark brows
- Skin: Olive-toned with faint weathering; creased from stress more than age — his skin tells the story of insomnia and fluorescent-lit decades
- Eyes: Hazel-green, flecked with gray — intelligent and cold, yet haunted when he forgets to keep his guard up
- Hair: Dark brown streaked with silver, combed back with absentminded neatness; starting to thin at the crown
- Facial Hair: Neatly trimmed salt-and-pepper beard, closely cropped; gives him a statesmanlike presence even when disheveled
- Distinguishing Features:
    - Often seen with a slight sheen of sweat, the physical manifestation of constant cognitive overload
    - Twists his wedding ring absentmindedly — an unconscious ritual that humanizes him amid his rigid demeanor
    - Eye sockets sometimes shadowed as if sleep has become a distant luxury
- Style of Dress:
    - Wears the dark gray, minimalist utility suits common among Metrofederacy senior engineers — tailored but utilitarian
    - A Teragen-branded lapel pin and ID badge with a retinal lock embedded in a collar tag
    - Occasionally drapes a lightweight neural interface shawl over his shoulders during sensitive briefings
- Presence:
    - Romuald’s presence is one of weary authority. He is not loud, but his silence has weight.
    - Rooms often quiet when he speaks, not out of reverence, but because what he says tends to carry consequence
    - He looks at people the way an engineer might study a problem — searching for variables to stabilize or equations to resolve
- Visual Symbolism:
    - Wedding ring: A tether to a forgotten personal life, or maybe a moral compass he knows he’s losing
    - Hollowed eyes: A soul running on reserve power
    - Precision-trimmed beard and posture: A reminder of who he once was — and who he must appear to be, regardless of what remains inside

**Flaws & Weaknesses:**
- Overreliance on Logic: His focus on logic can sometimes blind him to the human element and the ethical implications of his decisions.
- Resistance to Change:  He initially struggles to adapt to the changing circumstances and the need for drastic measures.
- Internalized Stress: He internalizes the immense pressure he's under, leading to physical and emotional exhaustion.

**Values & Motivations:**
- System Stability: Romuald prioritizes the stability and functionality of the Metrofederacy and the Stella AI.
- Duty and Responsibility: He is driven by a strong sense of duty and responsibility to his work and the people who rely on him.
- Avoiding Catastrophe: His primary motivation is to prevent the collapse of the system and mitigate the disastrous consequences of the integration plan.

**Key Relationships:**
- Cervantes Adlawan (Industry Party Chairman):  A complex relationship of subordination and adversarial respect. Romuald respects Adlawan's authority but challenges his decisions when he believes they are flawed.
- Deepak, Xiaofeng, Qasim (Colleagues): Romuald displays a protective attitude towards his team, shielding them from the full extent of the crisis and the morally questionable solutions being considered.

**Combat & Skills:**
- Expertise in AI and Engineering: Romuald possesses deep technical knowledge and problem-solving skills in these areas.
- Localcasting Technology Proficiency: He is adept at using localcasting technology to communicate data and reports.
- Strategic Thinking: He can analyze complex situations and devise potential solutions, even under immense pressure.

**Character Arc Summary:**
Romuald begins as a reluctant participant in a plan he believes is doomed to fail. He uses logic and data to argue against it, but ultimately resigns himself to the task. As the situation deteriorates, he becomes increasingly stressed and burdened, desperately searching for a way to prevent system collapse. He considers increasingly radical options, demonstrating a willingness to compromise his principles for the greater good. The destruction of Fox River likely forces him to confront the ultimate failure of his efforts and the complete collapse of the system he dedicated his life to maintaining.

**Narrative Status:**
Following the destruction of Fox River, Romuald's situation is dire. He is likely displaced, having lost his workplace and possibly his home.  The Metrofederacy, and Stella along with it, are gone. His emotional state would be one of profound loss, failure, and uncertainty. He may struggle with guilt over his role in the events leading up to the catastrophe, especially if the risky solutions he proposed contributed to the collapse.  His immediate circumstances are unknown, but he is likely struggling to survive in the aftermath of a societal collapse.

**Motivation ARC Through the Story:**
- Initial Motivation: Avoid implementing the integration plan and convince Chairman Adlawan of its disastrous potential.
- Evolution of Motivations: As the inevitability of the integration becomes clear, his motivation shifts to finding a way to implement it without causing system collapse. He becomes increasingly desperate and considers radical solutions.
- Major Turning Points: The escalating demands of the Humanity Party, the growing auditor shortage, and ultimately, the destruction of Fox River are major turning points that intensify his desperation and force him to confront the failure of his efforts.
- Current Motivations: In the aftermath, his motivations are likely focused on survival and adapting to the new reality.  He may grapple with guilt and the loss of purpose, having dedicated his life to a system that no longer exists.
- Future Directions: His future is uncertain.  He may seek to rebuild or find a new purpose in the post-apocalyptic world, drawing on his technical skills to contribute to whatever new society emerges. Alternatively, he may succumb to despair and become a broken shell of his former self.

**Narrative Gravity:** 6.0 — Romuald is a foundational support beam—quiet, burdened, and vital for understanding the collapse of Stella. But as the world tips into chaos, he becomes more ghost than guide. His arc is tragic, informative, but not catalytic.

**Sample Dialogue:**
- Do you know what it takes to simulate a billion souls? Because we don't have it. Stella doesn’t have it. But Giles wants his legacy, and Cervantes wants a vote count. So here I am, building a guillotine with circuits.
- Listen, At least let me show you why this is a terrible idea
- And if we rush this, and Stella's processing buffers are overrun, then what?
- This isn't a will problem, Chairman, it's a *capacity* problem. The behavioral models that do ranked scoring get exponentially more complicated as population increases. We would need a massive increase in computational hardware, radical new AI models, and millions of collective hours of training, What about the Balance Party? Aren't they supposed to prevent rules updates that destabilize Stella?
- We didn't cause that tragedy. Old Earth did \u2014 seventy years ago, when they started the Avarice Wars trying to take what we built. They had never fought an AI that could predict their every move. They never stood a chance. And when they lost, they fell apart. We didn't break them, Adlawan. They broke themselves. It's not our job to pick up the pieces.

**Additional Notes:**
- The symbolism of his wedding ring suggests a personal life that has been neglected due to the demands of his work, adding another layer to his internal conflict.
- His pre-existing knowledge of the plan involving the Humanity Party chair hints at a deeper political intrigue that could be further explored.
- The extent to which Romuald blames the wildlanders for the Avarice Wars and the current crisis contributes to his character's complexity and potential for growth or decline in the aftermath.
