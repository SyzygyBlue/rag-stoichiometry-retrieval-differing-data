**Appearance:** 
Jeb McTanner is a grizzled man in his early 50s, with a stocky, weathered build honed by years of field command. Standing around 5'10" (178 cm), he has a square frame and a commanding presence born of long military service. His face is angular and lined, bearing the marks of age, stress, and sun exposure — crow's feet, a deep furrow between his brows, and the rough skin of someone who’s spent decades under Wildlands suns and Fox River floodlights.
His short-cropped hair is a mix of faded brown and encroaching gray, cut in a no-nonsense military style. A salt-and-pepper beard shadows his jaw, trimmed to a tight goatee. His eyes are a piercing slate-gray, always scanning, always calculating, and when he speaks, it's usually with a subtle squint — the look of a man who’s seen too much and trusts too little.
Jeb typically wears the uniform of Fox River’s Tactical Response Group: a dark tactical jacket bearing the subdued insignia of the TRG, reinforced field pants, and scuffed combat boots. His gear is well-maintained but not pristine, reflecting a man who expects functionality, not flash. A holstered sidearm is often on his hip, and his gloved hands are callused from years of fieldwork and command.
Despite his rugged appearance, there’s a quiet precision in how he wears his uniform, clips his com stud, or cradles a rifle — the bearing of a professional. Jeb moves with the slow, deliberate gait of someone conserving energy for when it truly counts. After long nights, a faint whiff of whiskey might cling to his breath or uniform, a coping mechanism he keeps just barely in check.
He does not seek attention, but in any room or battlefield, his presence anchors others — the calm center of a storm. His expression most often hovers somewhere between unreadable and weary, but when he locks eyes with someone—especially Chase—it carries the gravity of everything he cannot say.

**Flaws & Weaknesses:**
- Internalization of stress: Jeb's tendency to internalize his frustration could lead to burnout or other emotional difficulties.
- Subordination to authority: Despite disagreeing with superiors, he ultimately follows orders, which could compromise his values in certain situations.
- Overly protective: His protectiveness of Chase could cloud his judgment or lead him to take unnecessary risks.
- Internal conflicts: Jeb struggles with the conflict between his loyalty to his superiors and his responsibility to his subordinates.

**Values & Motivations:**
- Loyalty and duty: Jeb values his responsibility to both his superiors and his team.
- Fairness and justice: He believes in treating others fairly and is driven to challenge unjust decisions.
- Well-being of others: He prioritizes the emotional and physical well-being of those under his command.
- Key desires: Stability and a sense of control in a chaotic environment. He desires to protect those he cares about from harm.

**Key Relationships:**
- Chase: Mentor/Subordinate; protective. Jeb acts as a mentor and protector for Chase, demonstrating genuine concern for his well-being. This relationship is central to Jeb's emotional arc.
- Master Scrivener Francis: Subordinate/Superior; strained. Jeb respects Francis's authority but disagrees with his decisions regarding Chase, leading to tension in their relationship.
- Margdelain: Subordinate/Long-standing acquaintance. Jeb has known Margdelain since they were both kids and understands her subtle cues. He respects her authority and anticipates her requests, even when unpleasant.
- The Chancellor: Subordinate/Superior; resentful. Jeb resents the Chancellor's inconsistent and harmful decisions regarding Chase.

**Combat & Skills:**
- Combat abilities and style: Well trained with rifle, pistol, and hand-to-hand combat
- Special skills and expertise: Leadership, command of military forces, communication.
- Emotional Intel: Reads people well, especially under stress. Uses this to nudge decisions without confrontation.

**Character Arc Summary:**
Jeb begins as the moral backbone of Fox River's military command, committed to protecting his unit even when political winds shift. His loyalty to Chase clashes with the Chancellor’s harsh directives, creating emotional and ethical tension. The disolution of Jessop's Order would have been a bright spot bringing about a new age for Fox River if the whole city hadn't been destroyed days later with nearly everyone in it killed, including Jeb.

**Narrative Status:**
Deceased – Fox River’s destruction wipes out Jeb and nearly all of the TRG. His emotional and narrative legacy, however, endures — especially in the psyche of Chase, whose guilt and trauma will be shaped by Jeb’s memory. Jeb represents the cost of integrity in a corrupted world, a benchmark against which future characters may measure their own strength.

**Motivation ARC Through the Story:**
- Initial: Protect Chase and preserve TRG stability during political unrest.
- Developing: Challenge increasingly unethical commands while preparing for worsening tensions.
- Climactic Turn: Fox River’s obliteration cuts short his efforts to stabilize and protect.
- Legacy Motivation: Posthumously influences Chase’s growth and trauma processing.
- Future Echoes: His moral compass may inform the resistance against those who destroyed Fox River.

**Dialogue Samples**
- He’s not ready. You know that. He knows that.
- With respect, ma’am… this is the wrong damn move.
- You want loyalty? Then don’t break the ones giving it to you.
- If Chase made it out… then we'll patch him up when he gets home.

**Narrative Gravity:** 6.0 — Jeb plays a supporting but crucial role in the narrative. He anchors Fox River’s morality, shapes Chase’s emotional trajectory, and offers readers a grounded moral counterweight to the chaos. His presence is felt in the decisions others make, even after death. While he doesn’t drive the primary plot forward himself, his narrative ripple effect is significant—especially in defining what is lost when Fox River burns.

**Additional Notes:**
Jeb's whiskey drinking in Scene 2 suggests a tendency to use alcohol as a coping mechanism in stressful situations.  His deep concern for Chase suggests a potential paternal or mentorship role that significantly shapes his actions and decisions.

Going forward, Jeb's voice, as always, should be grounded, professional, clipped but sincere—he avoids exaggeration, prefers action to words. His ghost may linger in Chase’s memories, a moral yardstick. Could be featured in dreams, flashbacks, or posthumous revelations (e.g., journals, recordings).
