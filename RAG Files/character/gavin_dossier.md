### Character Dossier

**Name:** Gavin (family name not specified)

**MBTI:** ESTJ

**Age:** Not stated

**Origin:** Three Shovels Caravan (caravanner)

**Occupation / Role:** Caravanner; fighter during raids/escapes (uses pistol/SMG)

**Affiliations:** Three Shovels Caravan (Mama Valorie & Davian’s leadership). Formerly positioned as Robyn’s arranged match; adversarial toward Quincy.

---

**Personality**
- Jealous and territorial where Robyn is concerned; uses humiliation and goads others to reclaim status (“roll dice or swing”). 
- Volatile and impulsive under the influence of **puro**; provokes public confrontations.
- Opportunistic and vindictive: escalates from taunts to theft and physical assault.
- Capable of momentary cooperation in combat (works the barricade, joins a “rescue”), but quickly reverts to self‑serving choices.

**Appearance**
- Not described in the provided sources.

**Flaws & Vulnerabilities**
- Alcohol abuse (puro benders) and poor impulse control.
- Violent escalation (uses a pistol as a bludgeon; later wields an SMG) and willingness to betray caravan norms.
- Insecure masculinity: taunts framed around “real man” tropes and dominance over Robyn.

**Values & Motivations**
- **Status/Face:** Needs to be seen as the one who “wins,” especially over Quincy.
- **Possessiveness toward Robyn:** Treats the arrangement as entitlement, not consent.
- **Self‑preservation:** Flees when plans collapse; abandons gear he can’t yank free.

**Key Relationships**
- **Robyn (arranged match → broken):** Leadership imposes the match on Robyn; later, Gavin claims Mama Valorie “broke it off.” Robyn rejects him and remains with Quincy emotionally.
- **Quincy (rival/target):** Publicly taunts, proposes a dice ultimatum over Robyn, and later assaults Quincy in the ravager camp; also steals her toolbox and pack. 
- **Mama Valorie / Davian (leadership):** Power behind the arrangement; Gavin invokes that power in his confrontations.
- **Demmy (skerv youth):** Witness to Gavin’s violence; Gavin threatens him during the assault episode.

**Combat & Skills**
- **Arms:** Pistol (used to strike Quincy); later seen with a **9mm SMG**; disarmed by Lesha in a later incident.
- **Field behavior:** Helps clear a barricade under fire; pushes with the men to open a route out.

**Character Arc Summary (within provided scenes)**
Gavin emerges as a jealous rival for Robyn and a simmering antagonist to Quincy. After a **puro** bender, he crashes a dice game at the Wildebeest and goads Quincy into a reckless wager over Robyn. Days later, amid a ravager ambush, he initially cooperates to break the barricade and rush a trapped kid—then turns on Quincy in the chaos, striking her with a pistol. In the aftermath, his pack contains **Quincy’s stolen toolbox**, and he’s reported to have threatened Demmy at gunpoint. Much later, he surfaces again armed with an SMG before being disarmed by **Lesha**; in the same span, “the Blacklight Syndicate” is mentioned in connection with him/that incident (involvement unclear).

**Narrative Status (in these scenes):** Alive; last seen post‑ambush and later reappearing armed; current whereabouts/affiliations unresolved.

**Motivation ARC Through the Scenes**
- **Initial:** Lean on leadership’s arrangement to claim Robyn; posture dominance over Quincy.
- **Crisis:** Drunken humiliation → dice ultimatum; then escalates to violence/theft during the ravager chaos.
- **Later:** Reemerges armed; becomes a recurring threat vector tied to outside actors (Syndicate mentioned).

**Sample Dialogue / Moments**
- “Cut this wire!” (barricade scene, under fire)  
- “Let’s go get that kid.” (points Quincy toward the shed)  
- “Mama Valorie broke it off… me and Robyn.” (drunk at the Wildebeest)  
- “Either roll the dice or stand up and take a swing.” (taunting Quincy)

**Narrative Gravity:** 7 — A catalytic antagonist who pressures Quincy/Robyn’s bond, triggers the Wildebeest wager, and escalates to attempted murder, seeding later plotlines that pull in Lesha and hints of the Blacklight Syndicate.

**Additional Notes**
- Theft and violence pattern: possession of Quincy’s toolbox; Demmy recounts threats and seeing Gavin strike Quincy.
- Robyn’s arrangement is an external imposition; her agency is to survive it while keeping Quincy safe—Gavin’s actions intensify their need for secrecy and restraint.
