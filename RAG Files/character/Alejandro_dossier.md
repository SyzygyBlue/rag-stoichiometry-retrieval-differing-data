#### Character Arc Summary
Alejandro begins as a frontline StellaNet reporter assigned to document Fox River’s devastation. The atrocity, coupled with Werner’s tri-D burden, pushes him beyond standard coverage toward an investigative path. He proposes formally shifting tracks (him to investigative reporting; Werner to forensic photography) and registering a case, prioritizing justice over safety. He accepts a producer-mandated detour to pick up a forensic investigator—Shelly—before continuing to pursue witnesses and leads. In the field, he co-leads operations, pilots the quadrafan during a live rescue, and helps extract Evelyn, a survivor whose account surfaces names tied to Calum-Tam. From there, Alejandro’s focus is to elevate the work from broadcast to proof and pursue those capable of “flatlining a city,” including next steps toward Broken Bow for fixes, leads, and evidence control.

**Narrative Status:** Alive; partnered with Werner and working with Shelly on the Fox River case (post-rescue of Evelyn).

#### Motivation ARC Through the Story
- **Initial:** Deliver a StellaNet report from Fox River.  
- **Shift:** Decide to investigate, not just cover; register the case and change career paths.  
- **Current:** Assemble tools/people (Werner’s forensic tri-D, Shelly’s analysis) and develop witnesses (e.g., Evelyn).  
- **Near-term direction:** Travel to Broken Bow to chase leads and secure chains of evidence.

---

#### Sample Dialogue
- “I took this job because I love people. Not for safety.”  
- “If someone massacred these people… and I didn’t even try… I couldn’t live with myself.”  
- “Once we submit this story, we’ll update our Stella career paths and register the case.”  

---

#### Notes
- Team dynamic is complementary: Alejandro interprets people; Werner interprets systems.  
- Shelly joins as the producer-recommended forensic investigator; the team rescues Evelyn and continues the case.
