**Character Arc Summary (within provided scenes)**
Robyn, a caravanner in love with Quincy, is forced toward an arranged marriage to Gavin “for the good of the caravan.” She compels Quincy to promise not to fight leadership, prioritizing survival and avoiding exile. Despite the imposed constraint, Robyn reaffirms love through tenderness and truth-telling, then confronts Quincy after a reckless gamble that jeopardizes their dignity and safety. Her arc embodies the INFJ tension between fierce loyalty and principled restraint, choosing survivable paths without abandoning core values.

**Narrative Status (in these scenes):** Alive with the caravan; later fate not established in the provided sources.

- **Middle:** Enforce promises to keep Quincy safe; maintain a covert path for the relationship to persist.
- **Later:** Reclaim dignity and trust after Quincy’s gamble; reaffirm love with firmer boundaries.

**Sample Dialogue (tone-faithful paraphrases)**
- “It’s Gavin. They’re forcing it—for the caravan.”
- “Promise me you won’t fight this.”

**Additional Notes**

- Scenes emphasize a rhythm of tenderness ↔ confrontation, mapping how INFJ integrity survives under coercive authority.
