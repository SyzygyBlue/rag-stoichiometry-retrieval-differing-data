---

**Personality**
- Charismatic, values‑driven, and publicly persuasive; deploys social theater and procedure to steer outcomes.
- Deeply religious and idealistic; frames choices in moral language (salvation, destiny, God’s will).
- Under pressure: emotionally intense (tears, lament) yet capable of rapid reframing and resolve when a “higher purpose” is invoked.
- Blind spot: can be manipulated by appeals to moral destiny and “ends justify means” arguments.

**Appearance**
- Later seen haggard and older, visibly shaken in the aftermath of Fox River’s destruction.

**Flaws & Vulnerabilities**
- Susceptible to moral reframing that justifies extreme actions.
- Overconfidence in righteous intent can eclipse practical ethics and civilian safety.
- Keeps meticulous records that become liabilities in hostile hands.

**Values & Motivations**
- **Redemptive mission:** believes in a divinely‑sanctioned future requiring difficult sacrifices.
- **Community & flock:** genuine love for his people; grief at their suffering drives his resolve.
- **Power as instrument:** accepts the need for forceful actors (e.g., ravagers) to achieve perceived greater goods.

**Key Relationships**
- **Giles Montague (brother):** Manipulative mentor figure who reframes Marcus’s grief into renewed commitment (“sheep vs. lions”).
- **Makko (warlord):** Brutal partner who berates Marcus’s “failures,” ties him to massacres, and threatens his life.
- **Chancellor Margdelain (rival):** Political opponent; Marcus executes a public parliamentary trap exploiting news about her son.
- **Quincy / Demmy / Evelyn (“caravanner girl, the skerv, the church girl”):** Lives Makko claims Marcus “let… live,” used to shame and control him.

**Combat & Skills**
- **Combat:** Non‑combatant.
- **Political / Procedural:** Parliamentary maneuvers, public narrative framing, coalition pressure, and covert coordination with external actors.

**Character Arc Summary**
A devout councilman and cleric, Marcus leverages public sentiment and procedure to outmaneuver rivals. After the annihilation of Fox River, he is shattered, weeping over the slaughter of people he served and loved. Yet, under Giles’s moral reframing and Makko’s coercion, Marcus recommits to a grand, redemptive vision that tolerates monstrous means. Torn between love for his flock and a belief that “lions” must do what “sheep” cannot, he hardens into an architect of a perilous crusade.

**Narrative Status:** Alive; politically active and increasingly enmeshed with violent power brokers.

**Motivation ARC**
- **Initial:** Advance a values‑driven agenda for Fox River through persuasive theater and council tactics.
- **Crisis:** Reels from the city’s destruction and personal responsibility implied by allies.
- **Ongoing:** Subordinates empathy to mission; accepts ruthless methods in pursuit of salvation/“greater good.”

**Sample Dialogue / Moments (tone‑faithful paraphrases)**
- “Point of privilege… I move we adjourn to honor the Chancellor’s wounded son.”
- “I’m not a killer… They trusted me. They loved me.”
- “What would you have me do?”

**MBTI Rationale — Why **ENFJ**?**
- **Fe‑forward leadership & social orchestration:** Engineers public sentiment and council procedure to steer outcomes; thrives in front‑stage persuasion.
- **Ni‑driven moral vision:** Reframes tragedy into destiny; accepts strategic alliances as necessary for the long‑term “salvation” arc.
- **Under stress:** Powerful emotions channeled into renewed mission; vulnerable to charismatic guidance promising meaning through sacrifice.

**Contrast (Why not INFJ / ENTJ?)**
- **Not INFJ:** More extroverted, theatrical, and council‑floor tactical than the inward, one‑on‑one advocate style.
- **Not ENTJ:** Motivated less by efficiency/power than by moral suasion and communal emotion; he leverages commanders rather than acting as one.

**Narrative Gravity:** 8 — A pivotal moral‑political force whose choices catalyze massacres, reshape alliances, and set the board for wider conflict.

**Additional Notes**
- Meticulous record‑keeping becomes a vulnerability when seized by opponents.
- The “sheep vs. lions” frame marks his pivot from pastoral care to crusading realpolitik.
- His grief over Fox River coexists with complicity in empowering those who destroyed it.
