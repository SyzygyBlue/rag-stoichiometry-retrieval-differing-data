She manages the women's group, domestic logistics, and social discipline, using arrangements and reputation to steer outcomes.

    "bio_200w": "Mama Valorie is the steel-spined matriarch of the Three Shovels Caravan, running the women's group and much of the domestic logistics while Davian fronts external security and trade. She polices reputation and gender roles, needling nonconformity and rewarding submission with tightly controlled concessions. Her authority is visible in the command trailer over maps and rosters, and in the way lieutenants like Margarite act on her direction. When she forces Robyn toward an arrangement with Gavin 'for the good of the caravan', she frames it as communal survival rather than personal punishment, even as those closest see the provocation. She clashes with Davian over exiling Quincy—her instinct for discipline colliding with his hard line against death-by-banishment. Later, under shifting pressures, she appears to dissolve the Robyn-Gavin match, signaling a pragmatic capacity to reverse course when optics or stability demand it. Valorie embodies the brutal arithmetic of caravan life: order first, even at a human cost.",
    "arc_200w": "Before crisis, Valorie's power is quiet but ever-present: assigning labor, policing presentation, and shaping norms. The refugee surge and camp tensions expose her methods—public needling of Quincy, private pressure on Robyn, and an attempted political purge that Davian halts. The arrangement with Gavin becomes her lever to enforce obedience, but it also crystallizes resistance, binding Quincy and Robyn through promises she did not intend. As consequences compound—market violence, dice-table brinkmanship, and internal dissent—Valorie reassesses. Gavin later announces she 'broke it off', implying a pivot from punitive arrangement to damage control. Going forward, she is poised to keep bartering small concessions for discipline, maintaining legitimacy with results more than affection. Her arc charts a disciplinarian adapting tactics to preserve the caravan's center of gravity.",
    "skills_120w": "Valorie excels at organizing domestic production, delegating through trusted lieutenants, and applying social pressure to enforce norms. She stages 'soft' interventions—measurements, invitations, reminders—that serve as levers of control, and she can escalate to hard options like banishment through political maneuvering. Her blind spots include contempt for dissenters, provocation that fuels backlash, and undervaluing dignity costs that later destabilize compliance.",
    "appearance_120w": "She is described in authoritative strokes rather than fine detail: aquamarine eyes gone hard, gray hair in a severe knot, voice that cuts like wire. The overall effect is of a disciplined, practical matriarch more defined by command presence than by ornament.",
    "relationships_180w": "With Davian (husband and leader), Valorie shares power but clashes over methods; he blocks her from exiling Quincy and insists the caravan not become killers. With Quincy, she polices gendered labor and presentation, alternating needling with tactical concessions (coveralls via Margarite) to keep control. With Robyn, she frames coercion as communal necessity, pushing an arrangement with Gavin to secure optics and reproduction. With Gavin, she elevates and later discards him as expedience demands. These ties show a leader whose relationships are tools of governance more than sites of intimacy."
