### Character Dossier

**Name:** Randy (family name not specified)

**MBTI:** Unknown (not stated in source texts)

**Age:** Born c. 2153 (12 in 2165; 13 in 2166; 17 in 2170)

**Origin:** Immigrant family to the Stella Metrofederacy (arrived from outside years earlier)

**Occupation:** Student / Engineering Prodigy — dual master’s (mechanics, electrical); preparing SAIR path for Ph.D.

**Affiliations:** Stella Metrofederacy citizen; Metrofederacy education centers; close personal relationship with Fay (neuroinformatics prodigy)

---

**Personality**
- Intensely curious and industrious; devours advanced coursework beyond age level.
- Pragmatic optimizer of his SAIR path; motivated by measurable progress and independence.
- Romantic and impressionable where Fay is concerned — affectionate, adoring, and trusting.
- Competitive pride in being “ahead for his age,” but still humble next to Fay’s accomplishments.

**Appearance**
- Not explicitly described in the provided sources.

**Flaws & Weaknesses**
- Susceptible to influence from Fay, including risky neurochemical self‑modulation via his neuroject.
- Overconfidence/over‑optimization tendencies tied to SAIR progress and accelerated academics.
- Youthful tunnel‑vision on achievement and relationship, which may narrow risk assessment.

**Values & Motivations**
- Mastery & Achievement: pours himself into engineering studies; proud of being far ahead for his age.
- Love & Belonging: prioritizes time with Fay even when it conflicts with SAIR optimization.
- Independence: eager to get his first job and his own place on his next birthday.

**Key Relationships**
- **Fay (girlfriend):** Older by three months; already holds a Ph.D. in neuroinformatics. She mentors/steers his neuroject settings and shares immersive creative projects with him.
- **Lucas (father):** Supportive engineer‑dad tracking family SAIRs; proud of Randy’s acceleration and pushes mentoring/service.
- **Michelle (mother):** Emotionally complex but recognizes Randy as evidence of Stella’s potential.
- **Shelly (younger sister):** Musically gifted; Randy’s death later becomes the core driver of Shelly’s investigative life.

**Combat & Skills**
- **Combat:** None noted.
- **Technical/Academic:** Graduate‑level math/physics by 13; dual master’s by 17 (mechanical, electrical); beginning Ph.D. track; hands‑on with advanced fabrication (direct plasma sintering) and collaborative VR/holotank world‑building.

**Character Arc Summary**
Randy begins as an eager immigrant kid enthralled by Stella tech, races through education as a bona fide prodigy, and falls deeply for Fay, whose brilliance and confidence both inspire and sway him. By 17 he has two engineering master’s degrees and is mapping a Ph.D. path while experimenting (at her urging) with neuroject settings for heightened experiences. His eventual death (details covered elsewhere) becomes a catalytic wound that shapes Shelly’s entire forensic crusade and echoes across the broader Metrofederacy plotlines.

**Narrative Status**
- **Deceased** by the time Shelly undertakes her forensic investigation; serves as a central emotional and ethical catalyst for multiple arcs.

**Motivation ARC Through the Story**
- **Initial Motivation:** Integrate, learn fast, and unlock opportunity within Stella’s system.
- **Evolution:** Balance SAIR‑driven achievement with love and shared experiences with Fay; begins trusting her neurochemical guidance.
- **End State (Book‑spanning impact):** Posthumous catalyst — his life and loss reframe the stakes of Stella’s ethics, the neuroject, and institutional accountability.

**Sample Dialogue**
- “No, dad, I got it… Just be there when I wake up. It’s going to be so cool!”
- “Hooray!”
- “Perfect.”
- “Yeah, let’s shut this down and go.”

**Narrative Gravity:** 7 — Although Randy occupies relatively few on‑page scenes, his scholastic meteoric rise, intense relationship with Fay, and death collectively exert strong gravitational pull on Shelly’s storyline and the series’ ethical core (AI, neurochemistry, consent, and institutional responsibility).

**Additional Notes**
- AR habituation appears early via personalized overlays in the family home, underscoring comfort with Stella’s pervasive augmentation.
- The Fay relationship is both emotionally elevating and a vector for risk (neuroject parameters, “Q13” adjustments). Their shared creative/technical play (VR sky‑balloon, holotanks) reflects a fusion of wonder and rigor that typifies Randy’s arc.
