    "bio_200w": "Robyn is an INFJ caravanner whose love for Quincy is tested by coercive leadership. Forced toward an arrangement with Gavin, she prioritizes survival by extracting a promise from Quincy not to fight, trading open defiance for a plan that keeps them together. She remains emotionally honest, reaffirming love through tenderness, but also confronts Quincy after a reckless gamble that made her feel cheap, reasserting boundaries and dignity. Robyn's presence is quiet yet decisive: she absorbs pressure, chooses survivable paths, and protects what matters without theatrics. Her integrity, patience, and protective instincts make her a stabilizing force within the caravan's brutal calculus.",
    "arc_200w": "Robyn begins as Quincy's partner under constant scrutiny. Leadership's forced arrangement shifts her into crisis management, where she protects both of them by insisting on promises that avert exile or violence. As circumstances worsen, she balances secrecy and truth-telling, reaffirming their bond while demanding respect. After Quincy's reckless wager, Robyn reestablishes boundaries and insists on dignity. Going forward, she embodies endurance through principled restraintâ€”holding the relationship steady against external coercion.",
    "skills_120w": "Robyn's strengths are empathy, emotional steadiness, and principled boundaries. She influences quietly, using promises as survival contracts to prevent catastrophic outcomes. She lacks combat skills and carries the weight of compromise, which can strain her emotionally, yet her calm integrity helps the pair endure.",
    "appearance_120w": "The sources do not emphasize physical description. Robyn is defined by presence: soft-spoken, resolute, and careful with truth in dangerous contexts.",
    "relationships_180w": "Robyn loves Quincy deeply, alternating between tenderness and hard conversations that keep them safe. With Gavin, she rejects an imposed arrangement that treats her as leverage. With Mama Valorie and Davian, she navigates pressure without escalation, choosing promises and restraint over open rebellion. These ties define a person who protects love and dignity within an unforgiving system."
