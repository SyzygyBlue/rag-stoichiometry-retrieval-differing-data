    "summary": "Shelly is an intellectually gifted, emotionally restrained investigator whose life pivots on the death of her brother, Randy. A prodigy with early certifications, she specializes in forensic analysis, audit-trail reconstruction, simulation data integrity, and autopsy logistics. She prefers painful truth over comfort and often chooses data and archives over people. After immigrating from Wildlander Free City to the Metrofederacy as a child, she grows into a stoic, independent adult whose obsession with Randy’s case becomes all-consuming. Accepting a Broken Bow field contract to investigate the destruction of Fox River, she rescues Evelyn from a collapsed structure and learns of connections to Demmy, Quincy, and Chase—names recognized by contacts Alejandro and Werner as wanted in the disaster’s aftermath. Evidence also suggests a manipulated data dump likely crafted by Fay, intensifying Shelly’s pursuit of corruption and falsified records.",

    "bio_200w": "Shelly is a forensic prodigy and emotionally restrained investigator whose life turns around the death of her brother, Randy. She passes certifications early and excels at forensic analysis, audit-trail reconstruction, simulation data integrity, autopsy logistics, and digital archiving and surveillance analysis. Preferring truth over comfort, she pursues evidence with obsessive focus and minimal regard for social ease. Immigrating from Wildlander Free City to the Metrofederacy at age seven, she grows into a stoic, independent adult whose self-neglect supports relentless work. While on a Broken Bow field contract to investigate Fox River’s destruction, she rescues Evelyn from a collapsed structure just outside the city. Evelyn’s information connects Demmy, Quincy, and Chase to the disaster, information that Shelly’s contacts Werner and Alejandro say matches wanted notices. Clues suggesting Fay authored a misleading data dump further commit Shelly to exposing falsified records.",
    "arc_200w": "Shelly is an initially enthusiastic student whose trajectory hardens after Randy’s death into a single-minded pursuit of forensic truth. Before the pivot she seeks advancement and family stability; after, she channels grief into methodical investigation of tampered logs, simulated reconstructions, and autopsy logistics. Accepting a Broken Bow field contract brings her to the Fox River disaster scene, where rescuing Evelyn forges a new vector: her work now intersects with names tied to the catastrophe, recognized by her contacts Werner and Alejandro. The dossier frames her as alive and rapidly ascending, moving from isolated truthseeker to a dangerous wildcard whose official credentials and precision threaten entrenched interests. Future direction centers on following Evelyn’s lead and pursuing connections to Demmy, Quincy, and Chase while probing who fabricated the data attributed to her mother, with Fay as a prime suspect.",
    "skills_120w": "Shelly’s skills include criminal and scene forensics, audit-trail reconstruction, simulation data integrity checks, autopsy logistics, and digital archiving and surveillance analysis. She recognizes tampering and metadata manipulation and is medically competent, having passed MD certification, with strengths in trauma anatomy and psychological response forensics. Tactically, she maintains strict chain-of-custody, cross-references metadata, triangulates sources, and tests hypotheses via simulations. Limitations include social withdrawal, bluntness, neglect of self-care, and a risk of collapse under sustained obsession.",
    "appearance_120w": "Shelly stands about 167 cm with a thin, wiry, almost gaunt build. She is very pale with visible blue veins, mud-brown shoulder-length hair usually tied back, and cool gray-blue deep-set eyes often rimmed with fatigue. Dark under-eye circles are near-permanent. Hands show ink or stylus grease, and a minimalist waveform tattoo sits behind her left ear. She slouches under inner weight, speaks quietly and precisely, and dresses in conservative, utilitarian layers in muted tones, consistently looking sleep-deprived.",
    "relationships_180w": "Shelly’s core bond is with Randy, her deceased brother, whose loss drives her forensic mission. She holds a complicated, longing relationship with Michelle, her mother, who left the family but urged her to keep searching; Lucas, her father, offers stability but withdrew into reclusion, collaborating with her on decoding clues. She rescues Evelyn near Fox River and, through this, connects to Demmy, Quincy, and Chase, whom her contacts Werner and Alejandro identify as wanted in the disaster’s aftermath. Fay becomes a focal antagonist when evidence indicates a data dump presumed to be from Michelle was likely crafted by Fay. These ties move Shelly from isolation toward entanglement with a broader conspiracy, while remaining grounded in her commitment to evidence and accountability."
