    "summary": "Jeb McTanner is a grizzled former Tactical Response Group commander from Fox River. An ISTJ, he is pragmatic, dependable, and emotionally restrained, guided by ethics and fairness. He protects subordinates—especially Chase—while navigating chain-of-command realities: he follows orders, voices objections when decisions seem unjust, and knows when to argue or obey. His communication is direct and respectful, with frustration channeled into terse words or controlled physicality. He reads people well under stress and uses that insight to nudge decisions without confrontation. Combat-trained with rifle, pistol, and hand-to-hand skills, he pairs field competence with leadership and clear command communication. The dossier notes coping via occasional whiskey. His narrative ends with the destruction of Fox River, which kills him and most of the TRG, leaving a mentoring legacy that shapes Chase’s guilt and growth.",

    "bio_200w": "Jeb McTanner is a former Tactical Response Group commander from Fox River whose principled, protective leadership defines his reputation. An ISTJ, he is pragmatic and dependable, voicing objections when orders seem unjust but ultimately executing his duty. He communicates directly and respectfully, channels frustration into controlled gestures, and reads people well under stress to nudge decisions without open confrontation. Trained with rifle, pistol, and hand-to-hand skills, he pairs field proficiency with calm command presence and clear communication. He cares deeply for subordinates—especially Chase—and prioritizes their well-being. His uniform is functional and worn with precise care, and the dossier notes occasional reliance on whiskey as a coping mechanism. McTanner’s story ends with Fox River’s destruction, which kills him and most of the TRG, leaving a legacy that shapes how survivors, particularly Chase, process guilt and resolve.",
    "arc_200w": "Jeb McTanner is a disciplined field commander whose arc tracks the strain between duty and conscience. He begins as Fox River’s moral backbone, committed to protecting his unit and challenging unfair directives while respecting the chain of command. Political turbulence intensifies around Chase’s treatment, sharpening Jeb’s frustration yet not breaking his disciplined approach. A brief institutional shift—the dissolution of Jessop’s Order—might have signaled improvement, but the destruction of Fox River ends his efforts and life within days. The pivot annihilates his command and community, transforming him from active protector to posthumous influence. After his death, the dossier frames his legacy as a moral yardstick that will shape Chase’s growth and trauma processing and may echo in future resistance against those responsible for Fox River’s fall.",
    "skills_120w": "Jeb McTanner is a combat-trained commander proficient with rifle, pistol, and hand-to-hand fighting. He excels at leadership, unit command, and clear, efficient communication. His tactical strengths include navigating chain-of-command dynamics, voicing principled objections while executing orders, and reading people under pressure to influence outcomes without confrontation. He maintains equipment meticulously and moves with deliberate economy. Documented limitations include internalized stress that risks burnout, a tendency to follow orders despite disagreement, overprotectiveness of Chase that can cloud judgment, and occasional reliance on whiskey as a coping mechanism.",
    "appearance_120w": "Jeb McTanner is a stocky, weathered man in his early 50s, about 178 cm tall, with short-cropped faded brown hair threaded with gray and a tight goatee. His slate-gray eyes scan constantly; his face shows crow’s feet, a deep brow furrow, and rough, sun-worn skin. He wears Fox River TRG gear: dark tactical jacket with subdued insignia, reinforced field pants, scuffed combat boots, and a holstered sidearm. Movements are slow and deliberate, uniform precise, and a faint whiskey scent may linger after long nights.",
    "relationships_180w": "Jeb McTanner centers relationships on duty and protection. With Chase, he is a mentor and protector, prioritizing the younger man’s safety and growth. With Master Scrivener Francis, he maintains respect for authority while disagreeing over decisions that affect Chase, producing a strained superior-subordinate dynamic. With Margdelain, a long-standing acquaintance since youth, he anticipates her requests and reads her cues while respecting her authority. Toward the Chancellor, he harbors resentment over inconsistent, harmful directives related to Chase. These ties show a pattern: loyalty to people under his care, willingness to challenge perceived injustice within the chain of command, and disciplined adherence to role even as frustration builds."
