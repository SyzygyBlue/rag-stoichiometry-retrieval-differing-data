He welcomes and pastors Demmy during recovery, prays with him, and frames the Order\u2019s mission as both mercy and righteous force. When evidence surfaces that higher clergy are collaborating with ravagers, Olafsen helps Demmy document messages and carries a note and screenshots to Chancellor Margdelain. He warns that Demmy intends to descend beneath Fox River to rescue Evelyn and urges protection of innocents. His actions bridge the gap between monastery and chancellery and set the TRG\u2019s seizure of the lower levels in motion.",

    "bio_200w": "Brother Olafsen is a gentle, dutiful cleric of the Divine Order in Fox River. He helps shepherd Demmy from the med ward into monastery life, prays with him, and frames the Order\u2019s mission as both mercy to the poor and holy fire against ravagers. When Evelyn\u2019s messages reveal senior clergy collaborating with ravagers, Olafsen responds with conscience over convenience: he preserves evidence, takes screenshots, and agrees to deliver them\u2014along with Chase\u2019s letter\u2014to Chancellor Margdelain. He warns that Demmy, convinced by scripture, intends to descend beneath Fox River to rescue Evelyn and may harm anyone complicit. Though risk\u2011averse by temperament, Olafsen acts decisively in crisis, becoming the bridge between the monastery and civil authority and helping set in motion the TRG operation that follows. His faith centers on protecting innocents and telling hard truths, even when they indict his own institution.",
    "arc_200w": "Olafsen\u2019s arc begins in pastoral routine\u2014welcoming Demmy, teaching tenets through mentors like Elder Florian, and presenting the Order\u2019s blend of charity and discipline. The turning point arrives when the abducted initiate Evelyn and a seized datapad expose collusion between higher clergy and ravagers. Torn between loyalty and truth, Olafsen chooses evidence and transparency: he captures the messages, carries Chase\u2019s note, and brings both to Margdelain, explicitly warning that Demmy is moving to the lower levels and urging civilian protection. This choice catalyzes a wider reckoning and empowers secular forces to intervene. Post\u2011pivot, Olafsen\u2019s trajectory points toward reform and cooperation with civil governance, tempered by the real danger of retaliation from implicated leadership. He remains pastoral at heart but no longer naive about the costs of institutional sin.",
    "skills_120w": "Pastoral care, de\u2011escalation, and trust\u2011building with traumatized youths; clear communication with secular leaders; basic evidence handling (screenshots, device context), and principled decision\u2011making under pressure. Weaknesses include deference to hierarchy and delayed confrontation until crisis, plus a lack of combat capability.",
    "appearance_120w": "Tall, blond, blue\u2011eyed cleric typically in pressed clericals or robes. Wears or carries the flaming\u2011sword pendant of the Order. Presentation is neat, approachable, and disciplined, conveying care rather than intimidation.",
    "relationships_180w": "With Demmy, Olafsen is a steadying pastor\u2014he prays with him in the ward, welcomes him into the monastery, and later gifts a flaming\u2011sword pendant before the rescue attempt. With Evelyn, he is concerned and alarmed after her abduction, committing to expose the truth. With Brother Ernesto, he forms a pastoral pair. With Chancellor Margdelain, he becomes a crucial witness and courier of screenshots and Chase\u2019s note, warning of Demmy\u2019s plan so innocents can be evacuated. With Jessop and implicated superiors, he shifts from deference to disillusionment and quiet defiance."
