---

**Personality**
- Composed, unflappable, and strategic; a behind‑the‑scenes operator who anticipates needs and manages optics.
- Dry wit and sardonic humor used as social grease and emotional regulation during political crises.
- Systems‑ and evidence‑driven; comfortable with data digs, financial forensics, and rapid information routing.
- Loyal consigliere who can be brusque or clinical when executing orders under pressure.

**Appearance**
- Referred to as elderly/older in office scenes; formal, precise mannerisms.

**Flaws & Vulnerabilities**
- Pragmatic cynicism (“everyone is being used”) can read as callous, especially toward Chase’s wellbeing.
- Preference for control and procedure may underweight human fallout in the short term.
- Tethered to the Chancellor’s agenda; his influence is powerful but derivative of her office.

**Values & Motivations**
- **Institutional mastery:** orderly process, quorum math, and tight agenda control.
- **Strategic advantage:** information asymmetry, message discipline, and timely leverage.
- **Loyalty to the executive:** protecting Margdelain’s position and executing her plan with precision.

**Key Relationships**
- **Chancellor Margdelain (principal):** Trusted fixer; manages her moods, provides intel in real time, coordinates moves in chamber and on the ground.
- **Jeb McTanner (TRG commander):** Relays directives; friction when orders conflict with troop morale and Chase’s needs.
- **Council & clergy (Jessop, Bivualier, others):** Tracks votes, pressures opponents, and probes irregularities.
- **Gatekeeper to visitors:** Screens, schedules, and escalates (e.g., Olafsen; Chase; Quincy).

**Combat & Skills**
- **Combat:** None (non‑combatant).
- **Skills:** Vote‑whipping, docket control, financial pattern analysis, multi‑channel comms, intel vetting, and persuasion.

**Character Arc Summary (within provided scenes)**
Francis functions as Fox River’s indispensable bureaucratic strategist. He ushers sensitive visitors, feeds Margdelain real‑time intel, reframes surprises into plans, and enforces message discipline. When Jessop hijacks the narrative around Chase, Francis helps Margdelain pivot to the “proud mother” role while scrambling to preserve the Metrofederacy vote. He also surfaces financial anomalies tied to Councilman Bivualier, enabling leverage and exposing a shadow funding conduit.

**Narrative Status:** Alive; at post; continuing to orchestrate operations in the chancellery and council.

**Motivation ARC**
- **Initial:** Secure momentum for Metrofederacy petition via tight chamber management.
- **Crisis:** Counter Jessop’s narrative coup; keep Chase as TRG optics asset; manage emergent clergy entanglements.
- **Ongoing:** Expand leverage via financial/communications investigations; maintain executive control of the board.

**Sample Dialogue**
- “Everyone is being used, Master McTanner… Francis out.”
- “Checking…” / “It’s for… Chase, your son. They’re congratulating you.”
- “With all due respect, Chancellor — no one else’s parent is the Chancellor of Fox River.”
- (Gatekeeping calm) “Two men from the clergy… here to speak with you.”

**MBTI Rationale — Why **INTJ**?**
- **Ni → Te strategic framing:** Rapidly infers intent from chaos (e.g., chamber applause dynamics, political traps) and converts it into a working narrative the Chancellor can play.  
- **Pattern recognition & abstract modeling:** Spots leverage in Bivualier’s transfer patterns and hypothesizes the unseen “official account” owner and motive — thinking in systems, not just ledgers.  
- **Te decisiveness & orchestration:** Issues crisp directives to McTanner, manages sublingual/aural comms, and enforces message discipline across actors and timelines.  
- **Low‑key interpersonal affect (Fi):** Dry, cutting humor and reserved empathy; prioritizes effectiveness over bedside manner, especially evident in exchanges about Chase.

**Contrast (Why not ISTJ / ENTJ?)**
- **Not ISTJ:** He’s more than a rule‑keeper; he *reinterprets* situations and plays the long game of leverage and optics, favoring strategic reframes over procedural conservatism.  
- **Not ENTJ:** He rarely commands directly in public arenas; instead, he architects plans and empowers principals — classic INTJ consigliere rather than front‑stage executive.

**Narrative Gravity:** 7 — A constant presence who translates crises into actionable moves, shaping high‑stakes outcomes without taking center stage.

**Additional Notes**
- Master of sub‑vocal/sublingual comms choreography during council sessions.
- Serves as Margdelain’s mood manager and rhetorical sparring partner, keeping her sharp without derailing focus.
- Investigative reach spans finance, security, and political theater; he maintains a wide, quiet network.
