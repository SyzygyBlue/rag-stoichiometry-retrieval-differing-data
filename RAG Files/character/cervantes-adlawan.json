    "summary": "Cervantes Adlawan is the Chairman of the Industry Party within the Metrofederacy. He is portrayed as pragmatic, authoritative, cynical, and calculating, with a communication style that is direct and often condescending. He prioritizes stability—especially of Stella AI—and seeks to maintain and expand his influence while controlling processes and people. The dossier frames him as willing to sacrifice others, showing little empathy toward those outside the Metrofederacy, and occasionally experiencing unease about the implications of his actions. Physically, he is a late-50s Filipino man, about 173 cm tall, medium build, salt-and-pepper hair, dark eyes, typically dressed in minimalist elite formalwear marked by an Industry Party lapel pin. He favors quiet command and measured gestures. Professionally, he excels at political maneuvering, strategy, negotiation, and persuasion, and understands rule-update mechanics and party infighting. His current posture is strategically silent: with Article 18 embedded in Stella’s rules and others carrying public risk, he avoids the spotlight to preserve influence.",

    "bio_200w": "Cervantes Adlawan is the Chairman of the Industry Party in the Metrofederacy, a pragmatic, calculating operator who values stability and control. He communicates directly and often condescendingly, favoring institutional levers and delegation to manage risk. The dossier emphasizes his willingness to sacrifice others and his limited empathy for people outside the Metrofederacy. Physically he is in his late 50s, about 173 cm, with a medium build, salt-and-pepper hair, dark brown eyes, and a preference for minimalist elite formalwear marked by an Industry Party lapel pin. He commands rooms through restraint more than volume, relying on silence, precision of movement, and unreadable microexpressions. Professionally, he excels at political maneuvering, negotiation, persuasion, and strategic thinking, with knowledge of policy mechanics and Stella rule updates. His current posture is to remain in the background while others take public risks, maintaining plausible deniability and preserving influence.",
    "arc_200w": "Cervantes Adlawan is an Industry Party power broker whose arc centers on adapting control strategies as political optics change. Before a major upheaval, he managed crises through realpolitik, central authority, and delegation of risk to subordinates while maintaining plausible deniability. A turning point arrives with the destruction of Fox River and the rise of compassion-driven optics that shift incentives across the Metrofederacy. In response, he becomes strategically silent, allowing others to bear public risk while he protects his position and influence. The dossier frames him as recalibrating rather than renouncing control: he stays out of the spotlight, tracks how Article 18 and rule validation proceed, and adjusts to an environment where sentiment matters alongside process. Looking forward, he is likely to pursue selective alliances and opportunistic plays that exploit instability, seeking to maintain relevance and power in a changing political landscape.",
    "skills_120w": "Cervantes Adlawan is adept at political maneuvering, negotiation, persuasion, and strategic thinking. He understands policy mechanics and the intricacies of Stella rule updates, enabling him to manipulate timing, risk, and institutional levers. Tactically, he favors delegation of risk and plausible deniability, leveraging others to carry public exposure while he preserves influence. He excels at reading rooms and applying pressure through process control rather than overt force. The dossier lists no combat abilities and notes limitations stemming from overconfidence and low empathy, which can lead to miscalculations when moral optics become decisive.",
    "appearance_120w": "Cervantes Adlawan is a late-50s Filipino man, approximately 173 cm tall, with a medium build. He has salt-and-pepper hair cut short with a conservative side part, dark brown eyes, and a composed, reserved demeanor. His default expression is tight-lipped and skeptical, with faint crow’s feet and vertical frown lines. He dresses in high-end minimalist formalwear typical of Industry Party elites—slate or charcoal suits over collarless shirts—and wears a subtle lapel pin indicating party affiliation. His presence relies on precise movement and minimal gestures, projecting authority without overt intimidation.",
    "relationships_180w": "Cervantes Adlawan maintains instrumental relationships aligned to control and stability. With Romuald Anwar, he initially delegates high-risk work on the immigration crisis, later viewing Romuald as expendable. With Giles Montague, he navigates a rival-ally dynamic, distrusting him yet cooperating as sentiment shifts toward compassion. With Li Mei, he treats her as a valuable informant and potential ally, trusting her intelligence and showing measured respect for her abilities. These ties illustrate his preference for leverage and information over loyalty: allies are useful so long as they reinforce stability and preserve his influence. As optics change, he adapts by pulling back publicly while monitoring processes others must manage."
