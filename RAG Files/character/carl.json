He relishes intimidation, using his fists and club to maintain dominance, and is known to beat prisoners nearly to death. Despite his cruelty, he is careful not to openly cross Lenya, whose authority he recognizes. His sadism makes him a constant threat to Chase and Quincy while they are imprisoned. During the chaos of the ravager attack on the holdfast, Carl attempts to kill Chase with a club, but is intercepted and slain by Demmy and Lesha, ending his reign of violence.",

      "bio_200w": "Carl is the feared overseer of Calum-Tam Holdfast, tasked with keeping prisoners compliant through intimidation and cruelty. He enjoys inflicting pain, breaking bones and spirits alike, with a penchant for fists and a heavy club. Chase becomes his primary target, enduring a savage beating that nearly kills him. Despite his brutality, Carl is careful not to openly challenge Lenya Tam, acknowledging her as the absolute authority. This creates a paradox: to prisoners he is a monster, to Lenya he is a blunt tool to enforce fear. His arc culminates during the ravager attack on the holdfast, when Carl, consumed by rage, charges to finish Chase once and for all. Instead, he is intercepted by Lesha and Demmy, who kill him with coordinated precision, ending his reign of violence. Carl embodies the abuse of unchecked authority—terrifying in the short term, but ultimately destroyed by his own overconfidence and reliance on brutality.",
      "arc_200w": "Carl begins as an enforcer, embodying the cruelty of Calum-Tam Holdfast. His role escalates through repeated confrontations with Chase, culminating in a near-fatal beating that defines his sadism. As the holdfast falls into chaos under a ravager attack, Carl seeks to reassert dominance and exact final vengeance on Chase. However, his reliance on raw force proves his undoing. Lesha and Demmy, fighting in coordination, neutralize him—Lesha tackling him low while Demmy drives a blade into his throat. Carl’s death symbolizes both the fragility of terror-based authority and the collapse of Lenya Tam’s order. He remains a vivid reminder of the violence prisoners endured, his legacy tied to the trauma he inflicted rather than any real leadership.",
      "skills_120w": "Carl’s strengths lie in intimidation and brute force. He wields fists and a heavy club with savage efficiency, inflicting fear and physical harm. He can control groups through sheer menace and shouting, backed by the willingness to escalate violence without hesitation. His weaknesses are his overconfidence, lack of tactical thinking, and inability to adapt against skilled opponents. His authority crumbles when confronted by courage, coordination, and superior combat skill, leaving him exposed as little more than a bully with a weapon.",
      "appearance_120w": "Carl is portrayed through presence and menace rather than detailed description. He is large, heavyset, and loud, with a voice that fills cells and courtyards. His face flushes with rage during confrontations, and his clenched fists and blood-covered knuckles reflect a man who thrives on violence. He is more an embodiment of brutality than a carefully described figure.",
      "relationships_180w": "Carl’s relationships define his function in the holdfast. With Lenya Tam, he is subordinate—obedient when threatened, yet eager to demonstrate violence on her behalf. With Chase, he is the tormentor, delivering a savage beating and attempting murder. With Quincy, he remains a looming threat, though his violence focuses primarily on Chase. Demmy and Lesha become his final adversaries, killing him during the holdfast’s collapse. These ties underscore Carl as a blunt weapon in Lenya’s arsenal, feared by prisoners and tolerated by guards, but never trusted as a strategist. His story ends not with triumph but with a brutal, bloody downfall."
