    "summary": "Margdelain is Fox River’s former Chancellor and a career politician who dominated narratives, rivals, and subordinates through calculation and coercion. She is ambitious, pragmatic, and acutely aware of optics, delaying gratification to achieve lasting influence. Her public charisma masks a tightly controlled temper and an inability to relinquish control, especially over her son, Chase, whom she attempts to mold into a successor. Strategically adept at bureaucratic manipulation and emotional warfare, she pursues sovereignty while seeking leverage with the Metrofederacy. Distinctive symbols of authority include the Chimera Seal Ring and a gavel when presiding. As missing caravans, intrigue, and her son’s rebellion strain her plans, the destruction of Fox River ends her rule and life. Her absence leaves a political vacuum and a ghostly imprint on those who survived her.",

    "bio_200w": "Margdelain is the former Chancellor of Fox River, a career politician who exerts control through calculation, coercion, and masterful command of optics. She is ambitious and pragmatic, willing to delay gratification to secure legacy and influence. Her public charisma conceals a volatile temper and an inability to relinquish control, most evident in her attempts to shape her son, Chase, into a successor. She wields bureaucratic manipulation and emotional warfare with precision, using symbols such as the Chimera Seal Ring and a council gavel to embody authority. As events undermine her plans—missing caravans, intrigue, and familial rebellion—her regime tightens rather than softens. The destruction of Fox River ends her life and rule, leaving a power vacuum and a lasting psychological imprint on those who endured her governance.",
    "arc_200w": "Margdelain is a domineering Chancellor whose stated goals include protecting Fox River’s sovereignty, gaining Metrofederacy influence, and engineering her son’s rise. Early success relies on narrative control, intimidation, and strategic patience. As crises mount—political rivalries, disappearing caravans, and Chase’s resistance—she doubles down on coercion and optics. The decisive break arrives with the destruction of Fox River, which ends her reign and confirms the brittleness of power built on domination and fear. In death, she persists only as memory, shaping the survivors’ choices and trauma. The dossier presents no posthumous redemption arc, only a legacy of control mistaken for care and purpose mistaken for love, with her ambitions shattered alongside the city she sought to command.",
    "skills_120w": "Margdelain’s capabilities center on tactical politics: manipulating bureaucracies, orchestrating public narratives, and conducting emotional warfare in private negotiations. She is a disciplined orator who deploys charisma as a weapon while thinking several steps ahead. Coercion and intimidation are normalized tools, and she times moves to maximize optics. Limitations are structural: a rigid need for control, flashes of temper, and a ruthless pragmatism that alienates allies and blinds her to alternatives. No physical combat skill is emphasized; her arena is institutional power and perception management enforced by symbols like the Chimera Ring and a gavel.",
    "appearance_120w": "Margdelain stands about 168 cm with a lean, blade-like build and an erect, disciplined posture. Steel-gray eyes scan relentlessly beneath long chestnut hair streaked with iron-gray, bound in a severe knot. Pale skin shows fine wrinkles and stress lines of late middle age. She favors minimalist, impeccably tailored suits or blouses, projecting austere efficiency. Distinguishing marks include the Chimera Seal Ring on her right hand. Her movements are sharp and economical; expressions are curated, with any warmth used as calculated misdirection.",
    "relationships_180w": "Margdelain’s closest and most volatile tie is with her son, Chase. She treats him as a project and successor, alternating cold patronage with deeply personal barbs when he resists. Master Scrivener Francis functions as confidant and analytic mirror, enabling her narrative control and bureaucratic navigation. With Master McTanner, she maintains professional respect while demanding results, chastising failure without emotional attachment. Brother Jessop embodies an external political threat and philosophical clash, their rivalry fought through maneuvering and influence. Collectively, these relationships reveal a structure of power over connection: allies are instruments, family is legacy, and opposition is a problem to be engineered away. After Fox River’s fall, her relationships persist only as pressure on the living."
