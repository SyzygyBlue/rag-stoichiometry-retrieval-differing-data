    "summary": "Chase is a young male TRG apprentice in his early 20s whose background links him to Fox River through his mother. He is pragmatic, observant, empathetic, and an instinctive leader who reads people well, communicates directly, and maintains composure under pressure. Internally conflicted, he seeks independence from his mother’s plans and strives to be recognized on his own merits. He demonstrates loyalty to those he chooses to help, including a temporary alliance with the Three Shovels Caravan, and favors justice over vengeance. In the field he is a capable marksman who prefers long-range engagements and strategic positioning, and he can pilot all-terrain vehicles. After the destruction of Fox River, he becomes physically and emotionally damaged; his left arm is replaced with a blue-metal prosthetic and his left eye with a cyber-optic. Despite losses to status and security, he retains an adaptive moral compass and aims to rebuild purpose from adversity.",

    "bio_200w": "Chase is a TRG apprentice and people-reader who pairs empathy with composure under pressure. He grew up under the weight of his mother’s expectations and rejects a pre-ordained political path in favor of earned competence. The dossier describes him as pragmatic, observant, dry-witted, and quietly commanding, with a habit of thinking in moves and countermoves. He forms a temporary alliance with the Three Shovels Caravan and shows a pattern of helping those others overlook, preferring justice to revenge. In the field, he favors long-range engagement and strategic positioning and can pilot all-terrain vehicles. After Fox River’s destruction he loses status and security and receives a blue-metal left arm prosthetic and a left-eye cyber-optic. Despite trauma, he maintains a loyal, idealistic compass aimed at rebuilding purpose on his own terms.",
    "arc_200w": "Chase is a legacy-shadowed apprentice who chooses TRG over a political track to escape control and prove himself. Early actions show courage and competence alongside a tendency toward impulsiveness when protecting others. The dossier frames a decisive pivot with the destruction of Fox River, which strips him of home, rank, and inherited protections. Post-pivot, he is physically altered and emotionally shaken, yet the throughline remains: a loyalty-driven instinct to protect the overlooked. His arc is summarized as a prince-to-ronin transition, moving from expectation to self-definition. The forward vector is conditional: if he integrates trauma with values like dignity and justice, he may evolve into a grassroots protector or leader; if not, unresolved guilt and manipulation risks could stall him. The current stance is recovery and reorientation rather than retreat.",
    "skills_120w": "Chase is proficient with firearms, notably a .50 caliber sniper rifle, and prefers long-range marksmanship with deliberate positioning. He is a skilled driver who can pilot all-terrain vehicles and brings strategic thinking to planning and movement. Tactically he favors overwatch roles, calm command presence, and step-ahead countermoves. Documented limitations include limited overall combat experience, impulsiveness in battle, vulnerability to manipulation due to his desire for independence, and a tendency to suppress emotions, which can cloud judgment.",
    "appearance_120w": "Chase stands about 185 cm with lean athletic build, broad shoulders, and an upright posture. He has reddish-blond hair cut short at the sides with a tousled top, bright expressive blue eyes, fair skin with faint freckles, and a clean, refined look. Post-Fox River, he bears a crooked nose and wears a blue-metal left arm prosthetic; his left eye has a subtle cyber-optic shimmer. In the Wildlands he favors TRG tactical wear with lightweight armor and polished boots; in urban settings he shifts to tailored, clean-lined attire.",
    "relationships_180w": "Chase’s closest bond is a strained mother–son tie with Margdelain: he respects her power and intelligence but resents control and works to assert independence. McTanner serves as mentor and father figure, offering guidance and caution that steady Chase’s choices. With Quincy, Chase engages in a professional helping relationship, assisting her and the Three Shovels Caravan in ways that reflect duty and compassion. Bonds with Demmy and Lesha are described as emergent, formed through shared survival and trauma and framed as potential found-family. These ties highlight a pattern: he values loyalty and will break rules to protect people he trusts, even as he balances authority awareness with skepticism about obedience."
