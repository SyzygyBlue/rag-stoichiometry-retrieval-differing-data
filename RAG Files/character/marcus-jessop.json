    "bio_200w": "Marcus Jessop, also called Brother Jessop, is an ENFJ cleric and councilman of Fox River. He is charismatic, idealistic, and religious, using moral theater to steer politics. After Fox River\u2019s destruction, Marcus grieves deeply for his people, but Giles Montague reframes his grief into destiny, and Makko coerces him into complicity. He believes lions must do what sheep cannot, sacrificing ethics for a higher mission. Marcus remains alive and politically active, representing the peril of faith reframed as crusade.",
    "arc_200w": "Marcus begins as a values-driven cleric and councilman in Fox River, advocating morality and community care. His crisis arrives with the destruction of Fox River, where grief overwhelms him. Under Giles\u2019s mentorship and Makko\u2019s coercion, he reinterprets tragedy as destiny, reframing himself as a shepherd of salvation who accepts violence by proxy. His arc charts a pivot from pastoral leadership to crusader, catalyzing massacres while cloaking them in divine rhetoric. He ends politically active, enmeshed with violent power brokers.",
    "skills_120w": "Marcus Jessop wields skills in parliamentary procedure, coalition maneuvering, and persuasive oratory. He is adept at narrative framing and exploiting council rules. His meticulous record-keeping aids tactics but also creates liabilities. He is non-combatant and vulnerable to manipulation via moral reframing.",
    "appearance_120w": "Marcus Jessop is later described as older and haggard after Fox River\u2019s fall, reflecting grief and coercion. Earlier appearances depict him in council and clerical attire, with emphasis on demeanor over physical detail.",
    "relationships_180w": "Marcus Jessop\u2019s ties define his arc. Giles Montague manipulates his grief into a crusade. Makko coerces him, berating and controlling his involvement. Chancellor Margdelain opposes him politically, with Marcus staging traps on the council floor. His people\u2019s love and their destruction haunt him. These connections transform Marcus from advocate into compromised crusader, enmeshed with violent actors."
