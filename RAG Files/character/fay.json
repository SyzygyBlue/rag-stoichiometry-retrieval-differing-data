    "summary": "Fay is an INTJ neuroinformatics and VR expert currently imprisoned at the Tahua Outpost under Li Mei for the Balance Party Special Projects division. The dossier depicts her as highly intelligent, methodical, manipulative, secretive, sadistic, and controlling. Her specialties include neurochemical manipulation via neurojects, VR design, cybernetics, and sophisticated malware capable of bypassing StellaNet. She previously presented as a playful, passionate designer while secretly conducting lethal experiments, including on a former partner, Randy. After a period of serial killings and a subsequent erasure from StellaNet, she continues her research under duress, plotting to undermine Li Mei. She treats Skree, a human-machine hybrid, as her masterpiece and uses pawns like Jejune through planted malware. Her narrative status emphasizes confinement, ongoing covert rebellion, and a focus on control, experimentation, and self-preservation.",

    "bio_200w": "Fay is an INTJ neuroinformatics and VR specialist imprisoned at the Tahua Outpost under Li Mei for the Balance Party Special Projects division. She is depicted as highly intelligent, methodical, manipulative, secretive, voyeuristic, sadistic, and controlling. Her toolset spans neurochemical manipulation through neurojects, VR simulation design, cybernetics development, and sophisticated malware that can bypass StellaNet. A former romantic partner, Randy, became a subject of her experiments. After serial killings and a complete erasure from StellaNet, she continues working under duress while covertly plotting to undermine Li Mei. She treats Skree, a human-machine hybrid, as her masterpiece and uses pawns like Jejune through implanted malware. The dossier emphasizes confinement, enduring intellectual dominance, and priorities of control, experimentation, subversion, and self-preservation.",
    "arc_200w": "Fay begins as a seemingly playful, passionate VR designer whose private life masks a psychopathic program of experimentation and murder. Her trajectory escalates from covert manipulation to large-scale technological subversion. A decisive shift occurs when she is erased from StellaNet and later held under Li Mei’s control at Tahua Outpost. Confinement narrows her operational freedom but not her ambition; she continues to direct harm through neuroinformatics, VR, human-machine interfaces, and malware, focusing on Skree as an instrument of future upheaval. The dossier positions her current stance as imprisoned yet ascendant in intent, with ongoing efforts to compromise intermediaries like Jejune. Looking forward, she is likely to exploit instability to rebuild a power base, extend control, and pursue knowledge without ethical restraint.",
    "skills_120w": "Fay’s strengths are intellectual and technical: neuroinformatics, neurochemical manipulation via neurojects, VR design, cybernetics development, and creation of sophisticated malware capable of bypassing StellaNet. Tactically she excels at psychological torture, surveillance, manipulation, deception, and control through implants while subverting authority. Stated limitations include no direct combat abilities, dependence on tools and implants, overconfidence, obsession that can cloud judgment, and the practical constraints of imprisonment under Li Mei.",
    "appearance_120w": "Fay stands about 168 cm with a lean, graceful frame and an eerie stillness. She has striking green eyes flecked with yellow, pale skin, and dark thick hair worn loose to frame her face. Movements are precise and calculated; posture is straight and controlled. She favors simple, form-fitting practical clothes in black or muted tones and sanitized lab attire, adding augmented-reality accessories if mandated by Stella. Her voice is smooth and confident, often mocking.",
    "relationships_180w": "Fay’s key ties are instruments of control or threat. Randy is a former partner turned victim whose resistance captivated her. Li Mei is both supervisor and captor at Tahua Outpost; Fay works under duress while seeking to subvert her. Skree is her engineered human-machine hybrid and intended tool for greater schemes. Jejune functions as a pawn compromised by Fay’s malware. Shelly appears as an investigator actively pursuing Fay’s crimes and disappearance. These relationships reinforce a pattern: she cultivates asymmetric power, uses technology to dominate or observe, and treats people as assets or obstacles in pursuit of control, scientific advancement, and subversion."
