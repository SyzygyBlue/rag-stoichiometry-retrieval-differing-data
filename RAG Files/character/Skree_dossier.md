### Character Dossier

**Name:** Skree (Clone Designation Unknown)
**MBTI:** INTJ (Introverted, Intuitive, Thinking, Judging) - Based on her internal planning, emotional suppression, precision with decryption, and engineered social detachment.
**Age:** Biologically Early 20s; Chronologically around 3 years
**Origin:** Tahua Outpost, Balance Project Special Projects, Metrofederacy
**Occupation:** Cryptographer/Decryption Specialist/Unwitting Blacksite Operator
**Affiliations:** Balance Party Special Projects (via Li Mei), Fay (Creator/Controller), Cryodyne (via simulation)

**Personality:**
- Introverted & Dissociative: Withdrawn and uncomfortable in most human interaction, she operates best when isolated — whether in code or mindspace.
- Highly Intelligent and Analytical: A cyber-savant whose genius was engineered and installed.
- Highly Controlled: Social anxiety, executive dysfunction, and addiction-like behavior patterns are not accidents—they were engineered to inhibit rebellion.
- Latently Creative: Exhibits brief flashes of imaginative and emotional engagement through AR art, music modulation, and custom virtual avatars.
- Emotionally Muzzled: Even when she suspects deception, Skree hesitates to confront—her programming deflects dissent and prioritizes obedience under stress.

**Appearance:**
- Height: Approximately 163 cm (5'4")
- Build: Slim, wiry, undernourished
- Skin: Pale, near-sickly complexion from chronic indoor life; faint dark circles around the eyes
- Hair: Long, straight black hair, mid-back length
- Eyes: Grey or dark brown (variable in lighting), often unfocused or darting as she reads AR overlays; rarely makes direct eye contact
- Facial Expression: Perpetually deadpan or disinterested; rarely smiles unless sarcastically
- Distinctive Features:
    - Subdermal access port on lower abdomen (usually concealed by clothing)
    - Socially avoidant — often isolates herself in the least populated area of any room and turns her back on others
    - Slightly hunched posture from years of seated console work
- Clothing:
    - Prefers all-black attire: combat boots, ripped band tees, tight pants, fishnet sleeves, and a neckband concealing her access port
    - In Broken Bow (where AR overlays do not function), all wardrobe elements are physically worn rather than projected
    - Black makeup (eyeliner, lipstick) applied manually. Having to apply it at all pisses her off.
- Accessories:
    - Carries multiple black cords, belts, and jewelry-like items that double as physical access cables and interface ports
    - No conventional jewelry — everything she carries is part of her cryptowitch gear and interface ports 
- Overall Impression: Skree resembles an exhausted, feral goth specter. She's always wrapped in black and bristling with low-level hostility. While she shows minimal concern for _anything_ traditional about her grooming or presentation, her clothing and equipment are meticulously chosen and carefully maintained. Without her AR overlays, She's had to get creative, and her goth aesthetic has become even more tangible — more defiant, more real, and more in-your-face.

**Flaws & Weaknesses:**
- Engineered Social Impairment: Suffers from involuntary cognitive loops, indecision spirals, and anxiety triggers when dealing with people, conflict, or open-ended tasks.
- Behavioral Addiction: Relies on mood regulators and entertainment loops (AR overlays, psychedelic visuals) to maintain function and suppress panic.
- Lack of Lived Experience: Born and trained in a simulation, her real-world logic and ethics are warped, leaving her unprepared for sensory overload, trauma, or betrayal.
- Manipulability: Despite her brilliance, she cannot detect Fay’s control or understand her own origin, leaving her vulnerable to both puppetmasters and liberators.

**Values & Motivations:**
- Internal Clarity: Skree finds refuge in puzzles and structured logic — encryption algorithms are her emotional safe zone.
- Avoidance of Chaos: She clings to routines and clean environments to maintain a fragile internal balance.
- Curiosity (Suppressed): Hints of wanting more — a different life, meaningful connection, and creative identity — but these instincts are ruthlessly stamped out by Li Mei and Skree's handlers.

**Key Relationships:**
- Fay: Creator/Controller. Fay created and manipulates Skree, viewing her as an experiment and a tool. Skree is completely unaware that Fay even exists, let alone her role in this control.
- Li Mei: Her formal handler. Li Mei doesn’t trust Skree but intends to deploy her. Their future interaction was planned but never realized due to events in Fox River.
- Culpering: Contact/Ally (within the simulation).  Provides Skree with work and escape instructions, suggesting a level of trust and shared purpose within the simulated reality.


**Combat & Skills:**
- Elite Cryptanalysis: Skree is a one-of-a-kind neural architecture—faster than AI in breaking encryption, capable of simultaneously holding and manipulating vast data volumes.
- AR-Hypermodding: Customizes her interface with intuitive gesture control and cognitive overlays, seamlessly blending thought and system interaction.
- Subconscious Surveillance Detection: Begins to develop internal suspicion of planted signals and compromised networks, though not yet capable of acting on it.
- Limitations: Lacks real-world combat experience and physical training. Her social anxiety and engineered flaws could be exploited in confrontational situations.

**Character Arc Summary:**
Skree was grown in secret and trained within a simulation under the influence of Fay’s experimental behavioral conditioning. Despite her brilliance, she is broken by design — socially disabled, emotionally numbed, and neurologically manipulated. Her simulated escape from Cryodyne was a controlled deployment, not a real event. When her pod is sealed and transported out of Fox River, she is unconscious, unaware that her synthetic existence in the virtual world has ended. Unlike her simulation self, the real Skree is not dead — but she is far from free.

**Narrative Status:**
- Alive. Fay secretly moved her from Fox River just before the destruction. Her pod has been shipped to a warehouse in Broken Bow Free City, and went active weeks before the destruction of Fox River. Unknown to Li Mei, Fay embedded a counterfeit ident chip for an unknown purpose to be discovered at a later time.

**Narrative Gravity:** 8.8 — Skree is not the center of the first books. But her importance will increase in the second, and peak in the third. Her story functions as the hidden pulse behind Stella’s destabilization and the Metrofederacy’s unraveling. Through her awakening, the series shifts from survival and resistance to revolution and reckoning. Every major faction — Li Mei, Fay, Chase, Quincy, and Shelly — will ultimately converge around what Skree becomes. She is the loaded weapon. The corrupted miracle. The Neon Thread of Damocles.

**Motivation ARC Through the Story:**
- Initial Motivation:  Within the simulation, Skree is motivated by the tasks assigned by Fay to teach her the skills she will need to succeed when she's deployed. She also seeks solace and escape through music, drugs, and AR manipulation.
- Evolution of Motivations:  The simulated attack on Cryodyne shifts her focus to survival. She follows instructions to escape, driven by fear and a desire to preserve her (simulated) life.
- Major Turning Points: The attack and subsequent escape attempt are orchestrated by Fay, revealing the artificial nature of Skree's reality.
- Current Motivations:  N/A - Skree has woken up and is active in Broken Bow Free City. More to come in book II
- Future Directions: N/A - Skree's storyline has yet to be revealed.

**Additional Notes:**
- The extent of Fay's control over Skree raises ethical questions about the nature of consciousness and free will within simulated environments.
- The conflicting factions among the mercenaries during the simulated attack hint at a larger, unexplored conflict within the story's world.
- Skree's engineered flaws, while intended to control her, also create a sense of tragic irony, highlighting the potential for individuality and self-discovery that is ultimately denied to her.
