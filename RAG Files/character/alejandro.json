    "summary": "Alejandro is a StellaNet reporter and field presenter who covers the destruction of Fox River and chooses to escalate from standard broadcast work into a formal investigation. He proposes shifting his Stella career path to investigative reporting while Werner moves to forensic photography, and he registers a case to pursue accountability. In the field he plans operations, pilots a quadrafan during a rescue, and helps extract Evelyn, a survivor whose account becomes a lead. He works closely with Werner, whose systems focus complements Alejandro’s people focus, and he coordinates with Shelly after a producer-mandated detour adds her as a forensic investigator. Alejandro emphasizes witness development, evidence control, and next steps through Broken Bow to secure leads and proof rather than just a tri-D story.",

    "bio_200w": "Alejandro is a StellaNet reporter and field presenter who escalates a Fox River assignment into an investigative case. He proposes changing his Stella career path to investigative reporting while Werner shifts to forensic photography, and he registers the case to push for accountability. In the field he plans operations and pilots a quadrafan to lift debris during a survivor rescue. He works closely with Werner, whose systems work complements Alejandro’s people-centric approach, and coordinates with Shelly after a producer-mandated detour adds her as forensic investigator. His focus turns to developing witnesses, securing discretionary funds for a fixer or mercs to control evidence flow, and elevating the work from a ninety-second broadcast to proof. He emphasizes truth, accountability, and loyalty to colleagues and survivors while managing his sensitivity to extreme tri-D immersion.",
    "arc_200w": "Alejandro is a frontline presenter who pivots when Fox River’s devastation demands more than a standard segment. He initiates a formal case, updates his track to investigative reporting, and aligns Werner toward forensic photography. A producer’s directive adds Shelly to the team, and Alejandro integrates her skills as they collect leads. He co-leads operations, flies the quadrafan during a live rescue, and helps extract Evelyn, turning raw footage into actionable investigation. His near-term plan is to move from broadcast impact to evidentiary rigor, travel to Broken Bow for fixers and leads, and build a chain of custody that can survive scrutiny. The arc reframes him from presenter to investigator whose choices balance public storytelling with securing proof and protecting survivors.",
    "skills_120w": "Alejandro is a field presenter turned investigator with strengths in tri-D broadcast ops, quadrafan piloting, and rapid operational planning. He uses a PID for notes, coordinates, and case actions, and a lingual interface for SAIR control and inflight menus. He plans resource use, proposes discretionary funds and local support to secure artifacts before scavengers remove them, and focuses on witness development to convert scenes into testimony. Limitations include nausea and retching under extreme full-immersion tri-D; he manages exposure and leans on team support to maintain performance.",
    "appearance_120w": "Alejandro is tall and athletic with raven-black hair worn in a ponytail and a poised, well-adjusted posture. He presents cleanly on camera with dark eyelashes, clear skin, and titanium-white teeth. His wardrobe includes a tailored Savachini suit for broadcasts, reinforcing a polished, credible presence. The overall effect is confident and composed, suited to high-pressure reporting and interviews, while remaining functional enough for field operations and rapid redeployments between flight deck, report area, and rescue sites.",
    "relationships_180w": "Alejandro is partnered with Werner, forming a complementary duo: Alejandro manages people, interviews, and planning; Werner manages drones, tri-D stitching, and forensic capture. Their working bond is supportive and warm, with Alejandro mitigating Werner’s tri-D burden and nausea while coordinating tasks. Alejandro also collaborates with Shelly, a producer-recommended forensic investigator added before deeper fieldwork; he integrates her analysis and search protocols into the case. In the field, Alejandro, Werner, and Shelly jointly rescue Evelyn from debris near Fox River. Evelyn’s survival provides witness testimony and names that inform next steps. Together, these relationships drive the team from a fast broadcast package toward a structured investigation, with Alejandro balancing narrative needs against evidentiary control."
