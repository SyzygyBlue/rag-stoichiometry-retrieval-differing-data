    "summary": "Giles Montague is a senior Metrofederacy politician and Chairman of the Humanity Party. An INTJ with intense internal values, he frames himself as a humanitarian reformer aiming to integrate the Wildlands into the Metrofederacy through legislation and technocratic absorption. His dossier presents a persuasive strategist who tailors rhetoric to audience, leverages bureaucracy and AI systems like StellaNet permissions, and rationalizes deception, neurochemical coercion, and clandestine violence as necessary governance. He engages Blacklight Syndicate via Makko for deniable operations and emotionally manipulates his brother, Marcus Jessop, despite guilt. The destruction of Fox River, carried out through his Blacklight deals, shatters his illusion of control yet he remains politically untouched and continues planning around Stella’s evolution and Article 18 maneuvering. His presence is calculating, aloof, and meticulously groomed, projecting calm authority while compartmentalizing moral cost.",

    "bio_200w": "Giles Montague is the Chairman of the Humanity Party and a Metrofederacy power broker who frames Wildlands integration as humanitarian reform. He is an INTJ strategist with persuasive range, able to evoke moral outrage or intellectual appeal as needed. The dossier describes him leveraging bureaucracy and AI systems such as StellaNet permissions while justifying deception, neurochemical coercion, and clandestine violence as tools of necessary governance. He contracts the Blacklight Syndicate through Makko for deniable operations and emotionally manipulates his brother, Marcus Jessop. The destruction of Fox River, executed through his Blacklight deals, exposes the cost of his program, yet he remains politically untouched and continues planning around Stella’s evolution and Article 18 quorum maneuvers. His presence is carefully groomed and controlled, projecting calm authority while compartmentalizing moral debt.",
    "arc_200w": "Giles Montague is introduced as a charismatic reformer proposing to absorb Wildlanders into the Metrofederacy by legislation and technocratic systems. Beneath that image, he cuts secret deals, applies neurochemical pressure, and manipulates peers and family. The destruction of Fox River collapses his sense of controlled progress and constitutes a hidden atrocity linked to his arrangements with the Blacklight Syndicate. In response he doubles down, consoling and steering Marcus while recasting the narrative for operatives like Makko. The dossier states he currently faces no direct consequences and intends to steer Stella’s evolution and Article 18 maneuvering while assuming public attention will shift. Forward motion likely involves salvaging integration via ethically gray mechanisms such as the neuroject-auditor loop and contingency alliances, with overconfidence flagged as a risk.",
    "skills_120w": "Giles Montague excels at political rhetoric, long-horizon planning, and targeted persuasion. He frames crises to mobilize votes, manipulates emotions, and anticipates downstream consequences. He leverages institutional machinery and AI permissions such as StellaNet to advance rules updates and control processes. Tactically he employs deception, compartmentalization, neurochemical coercion, and deniable force via contractors like the Blacklight Syndicate. Documented limitations include lack of combat skill, isolation from true allies, arrogance from conviction, and suppressed emotion that can distort judgment.",
    "appearance_120w": "Giles Montague appears priestly and composed in his early sixties, with light skin marked by age freckles and blemishes. Large, deep-set eyes sit beneath heavy brows; deep lines cross his forehead and mouth. Hair is short, tidy, and graying at the temples. He favors muted, elegant clothing—dark high-collared coats, crisp shirts, tailored trousers—with discreet Humanity Party insignia. Movements are measured; voice steady and resonant. In private, fatigue shows as a slight hunch, brief pauses before rising, and an occasional tremor.",
    "relationships_180w": "Giles Montague’s ties are instrumental. With Cervantes Adlawan, he manages rivalry and bureaucratic obstacles with condescension. He treats Romuald Anwar as a valuable tool, exploiting expertise while ignoring reservations. His relationship with his brother, Marcus Jessop, is complex: shared hardship sits beside manipulation, guilt, and the knowledge that Marcus will be sacrificed to the plan. Through Makko, he contracts the Blacklight Syndicate to execute deniable violence supporting integration aims. These dynamics display compartmentalized morality and preference for leverage over loyalty, reinforcing a pattern where humanitarian rhetoric masks coercive methods."
