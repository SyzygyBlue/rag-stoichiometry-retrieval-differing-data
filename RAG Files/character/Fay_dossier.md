**Occupation:** Neuroinformatics and VR designer (formerly); Researcher/Experimenter at Balance Party Special Projects (currently)
**Affiliations:** Balance Party Special Projects Division; Potentially affiliated with unknown actors who facilitated her erasure from StellaNet.

**Personality:**
- Psychopathic: Fay exhibits a profound lack of empathy, deriving pleasure from the suffering and degradation of others. She views victims as disposable tools for her experiments.
- Highly Intelligent and Resourceful:  She possesses exceptional intelligence, particularly in neuroinformatics, VR design, cybernetics, and biotechnology. She's highly skilled at circumventing security measures and developing advanced malware.
- Methodical and meticulous:  She conducts experiments with precision, carefully documenting her findings and refining her techniques.
- Manipulative & Deceptive: Fay is a master of manipulation, using charm, feigned cooperation, and advanced technology to control others and further her own hidden agendas.
- Secretive and manipulative:  Fay hides her true intentions and uses deception to achieve her goals.
- Voyeuristic and Sadistic: She enjoys observing others' pain and suffering, especially those she deems physically attractive. Especailly men.
- Controlling: Fay desires absolute control over her environment, her creations (like Skree), and the people around her, particularly Randy.

**Appearance:** 
- Fay is a beautiful and unsettling presence. Several inches shorter than Randy, she is 5'6" (168 cm) tall and has striking green eyes flecked with yellow — bright, intelligent, and alive with malice disguised as mischief. Her skin is pale and her dark hair is thick and usually worn loose, hanging naturally to frame her face in a way that enhances her allure, though she’s never vain. Fay’s features are symmetrical and almost delicate, but her expressions range from coy to coldly analytical, and her smiles rarely reach her eyes. She has a lean, graceful frame, like a person who frequently forgets to eat. She's not athletic, but agile. Her movements are precise, practiced, and always calculated. There’s an eerie stillness to her when she’s not performing socially.

Her voice is smooth and confident, sometimes indulgent, often mocking. Her posture is straight, controlled, and unflinching even under pressure. Fay tends to wear simple, form-fitting clothing when not in her lab coat — always practical, usually black or muted tones — and augmented reality accessories if Stella mandates fashion. In the lab, she wears sanitized work attire with minimal adornment, her only accessory a small set of tools or a custom neuroject interface on her wrist.

Despite her youth, Fay exudes a clinical detachment and calm intensity that gives her a presence far beyond her age. Those who meet her often feel simultaneously intrigued and wary, sensing that something dangerous simmers just below the surface.

**Flaws & Weaknesses:**
- Overconfidence:  Fay's belief in her intellectual superiority might lead her to underestimate opponents or take unnecessary risks.
- Obsessive tendencies:  Her fixation on Randy and the mercenaries could cloud her judgment and expose her to danger.
- Dependence on technology: Her reliance on tools and implants might make her vulnerable in situations where these are unavailable.
- Arrogance: Her genius often leads to disdain for others, which could make her underestimate opponents or overlook crucial details.
- Extreme Psychopathy: While a driving force, her psychopathy also isolates her and makes genuine connection impossible, potentially leading to overconfidence or underestimation of human unpredictability.
- Imprisonment: Despite her intelligence, she is currently imprisoned and working under duress for Li Mei, limiting her immediate freedom and scope of action.

**Values & Motivations:**
- Control:  Her overarching motivation is to control others and environments, whether through neurochemical manipulation, virtual reality, or direct power.
- Creative Expression (Darkly): Her passion for VR design and neuroinformatics is a form of creative expression, albeit one twisted by her sadistic tendencies. She relishes creating and perfecting her "masterpieces" like Skree.
- Scientific advancement:  She's genuinely fascinated by neurochemistry and cybernetics, pursuing knowledge and pushing the boundaries of these fields.
- Self-preservation:  Fay prioritizes her own safety and freedom, as evidenced by her erasure from StellaNet and her manipulative tactics.
- Subversion of Authority: Fay actively seeks to undermine figures of authority, particularly Li Mei, and seize power for herself.
- Chaos and Destruction: Her ultimate desire may be to witness or instigate widespread chaos and societal breakdown.

**Key Relationships:**
- Randy: Formerly her romantic partner, he became her favorite victim due to his resistance. He represents a unique challenge and an enduring fascination for her.
- Li Mei: Her superior at Balance Party Special Projects. Fay harbors deep resentment for Li Mei, who imprisoned her, and actively seeks to subvert her control. This is a forced professional relationship with an underlying antagonistic dynamic.
- Skree: Fay's "masterpiece" and creation, a human-machine hybrid. She controls Skree through neuroject implants and a modified corpus callosum interface, viewing Skree as a powerful tool for her own goals.
- Jejune: A pawn in Fay's schemes, infected with her malware. Fay views Jejune with contempt and uses her to further her rebellion against Li Mei.
- Shelly: Randy's brother (deceased), Shelly has focused her life on finding out who killed her brother and bring him to justice. She has spent every available moment of her young life developing the skills and Stella certifications to do this. Now she's an investigator actively pursuing Fay's crimes and disappearance.

**Clinical Psychopathy Traits:**
- Zero affective empathy
- High cognitive empathy (can read emotions but not feel them)
- Narcissistic grandiosity
- Sadistic pleasure in control, especially over attractive men
- No guilt or shame; sees morality as a manipulation tool

**Combat & Skills:**
- Neuroinformatics Expert: Highly skilled in brain chemistry, neurochemical manipulation, and the hacking and subversion of neuroject implants to take control of her victims.
- VR Design & Cybernetics: Proficient in designing realistic VR simulations and developing human-machine hybrids.
- Hacking & Malware Development: Capable of bypassing advanced security systems (StellaNet) and creating sophisticated malware (SCALPEL scripts).
- Psychological Torture: Expert in breaking down individuals mentally and physically through controlled neurochemical dosing and psychological manipulation.
- No direct combat abilities: Her strength lies in intellectual and technological manipulation rather than physical confrontation.

**Character Arc Summary:**
Fay begins as a seemingly playful and passionate VR designer, deeply engaged in her creative work and her romantic relationship with Randy. However, beneath this façade lies a psychopathic killer with a genius-level intellect for neuroinformatics. She uses her knowledge to manipulate Randy and countless other victims, seeing them as subjects for her twisted experiments. After a period of prolific serial killings, she is seemingly erased from StellaNet, suggesting a powerful accomplice or protector. Later, she is revealed to be a prisoner of Li Mei at the Tahua Outpost, where she continues her work on human-machine hybrids like Skree, all while secretly plotting to undermine Li Mei and further her own agenda. Her journey is one of escalating ambition and the chilling revelation of her true, deeply disturbing nature, moving from subtle manipulation to grand-scale technological subversion.

**Narrative Status:**
Fay is currently imprisoned at the Tahua Outpost in Northwestern Bolivia, working under the supervision of Li Mei for the Balance Party Special Projects division. While physically confined, she retains her formidable intellect and is actively developing advanced human-machine hybrids like Skree, all while secretly deploying malware and plotting against her captors. The destruction of Fox River, a major turning point for other characters, does not directly impact Fay's immediate physical location or her work at Tahua Outpost. Emotionally, she remains detached and sadistic, likely deriving a perverse satisfaction from the chaos and devastation that may be unfolding in the outside world, seeing it as a potential opportunity for her own ambitions. Her key "loss" is her freedom, but she consistently strives to regain control and subvert authority.

**Motivation ARC Through the Story:**
- Initial Motivation:  Balancing her scientific pursuits with her sadistic desires, maintaining a facade of normalcy while secretly manipulating Randy and other victims.
- Evolution of Motivations: As her crimes are investigated, her focus shifts to self-preservation and evading detection. She is forced into a subservient role under Li Mei, which intensifies her desire for autonomy and revenge.
- Major Turning Points: Randy's discovery of her crimes and the subsequent erasure of her digital footprint force her underground. The destruction of Fox River removes her established base of operations and likely forces her to adopt a new survival strategy.
- Current Motivations (Post-Fox River): Survival, rebuilding her resources, and potentially seeking revenge against those who threatened her. Her scientific curiosity likely persists, albeit constrained by her circumstances.
- Future Directions:  Fay might seek to establish a new power base, exploiting the chaos of the post-apocalyptic world. Her scientific expertise could be a valuable asset, allowing her to manipulate and control others in the struggle for resources and dominance.  She may also continue to pursue her research, driven by a desire for knowledge and a morbid fascination with the human brain.

**Motivational Priority (Approximate Stack):**
- Control of others (mental, physical, social)
- Scientific experimentation and data extraction
- Subversion of authority (especially Li Mei)
- Voyeuristic curiosity and sadistic pleasure
- Self-preservation (when truly threatened)

**Speech Pattern and Vocabulary**
- Calm, clinical, detached — even when discussing horror
- Occasionally florid when describing beauty or design
- Uses poetic or overly intellectual phrasing when amused or condescending
- Rarely raises her voice; uses pauses and silence as intimidation
- Examples:
    - "I find it fascinating how the human brain can be both a source of beauty and a tool for control."
    - "Was he really a _victim_? He would never have amounted to anything before I murdered him. Imagine all the good he's done now that he's dead. Honestly, if he were alive, he'd thank me."
    - About Jejune, knowing her malware was in place and the woman was doomed to die: "Tick-tock little fish."
    - Watching her gladiators spar while touching herself while splayed out on her couch: "Oh, how I long to hear you call my name."
    - About Skree: "You are going to burn the world down, my pet. You just don't know it yet. Fortunately, neither does Li Mei — for now. But you will. You both will."
    
**Narrative Function:**
- Architect of horror; antagonist to empathy, trust, and bodily autonomy
- Symbolizes corruption of knowledge and systemic cruelty
- Catalyst for societal collapse and chaos (Especially, her plans to trigger Skree's embedded malware and releases her from Li Mei's control)
- Moriarty to Shelly's Holmes
- The world's most dangerous woman

**Narritive Gravity:** 10 — Fay alters power dynamics in every scene. She introduces tension, threat, and moral degradation through presence alone. Her knowledge, schemes, and sadism shape other characters’ arcs and world events. Even her *absence* can create mystery or danger.

**Additional Notes:**
- Fay's erasure from StellaNet suggests powerful connections or a remarkable ability to manipulate advanced systems. (Li Mei, protecting her assett from having to face any rightful justice?) This skill set could be crucial in the post-Fox River environment.
- The extent of Fay's resources and her access to technology after the destruction of Fox River remain unknown and will likely shape her future actions.
-  Fay’s psychopathy makes her a dangerous wildcard, capable of extreme cruelty and unpredictable behavior.
- Fay is a psychopath, a genius, and a sadist. She would be a threat to the world if she wanted to take over. But really, she just wants to watch it burn — and she's smart enough to do it.
