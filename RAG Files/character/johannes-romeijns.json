    "summary": "Johannes Romeijns is the cautious, duty-bound Prime Minister of the Balance Party and a member of the Stella Governance Council. He prioritizes systemic equilibrium, legitimacy, and the preservation of Stella’s governance, communicating in a tentative, deferential style that can flare into anxious urgency under pressure. He is conscientious and ethically minded, but timidity and dependence on stronger personalities—particularly Li Mei—undermine decisive leadership. The disappearance of Councilor Nhan and a sealed Article 18 rule trigger his crisis, pushing him from proceduralism into realpolitik. To delay a critical vote, he reluctantly authorizes a clandestine plan to make three councilors “disappear,” compromising his moral position while attempting to protect the system. He has no noted combat skills; his competencies are administrative coordination, regulatory process, and cross-faction diplomacy. Physical details are limited; he presents as a neat Balance Party professional with non-confrontational body language and stress tics. His standing remains vital but precarious as he manages fallout.",

    "bio_200w": "Johannes Romeijns is the Prime Minister of the Balance Party and a member of the Stella Governance Council who prioritizes systemic equilibrium and legitimacy. He communicates cautiously and deferentially, with anxious urgency surfacing under pressure. The dossier emphasizes conscientious ethics and a desire to protect Stella’s governance rules, alongside timidity and dependence on stronger personalities such as Li Mei. When Councilor Nhan disappears and a sealed Article 18 rule threatens Stella’s integrity, his mitigation-first instincts are tested. Lacking combat ability, he contributes through administrative coordination, regulatory process, and cross-faction diplomacy. Physical details are limited; he appears as a neat Balance Party professional with non-confrontational body language and stress tics. His position remains central yet precarious after he authorizes a clandestine delay tactic that undercuts his moral footing while attempting to preserve the system he values.",
    "arc_200w": "Johannes Romeijns is a principled proceduralist whose arc turns when Councilor Nhan vanishes and Article 18 surfaces as a sealed rule. Initially focused on maintaining order through recognized processes, he is drawn into Li Mei’s covert strategy as fear of systemic collapse rises. The crisis point arrives when he consents to “disappear” three councilors to delay a pivotal vote, sacrificing ethical certainty for survival of Stella’s legitimacy. This choice erodes his moral high ground and deepens his dependence on a ruthless ally, shifting him from steward of equilibrium to practitioner of reactive triage. He remains in power but strained, navigating fallout while hoping the rule engine endures. The dossier frames his future as contingent: he may regain agency and resolve or become increasingly unstable and manipulated, determined by the gambit’s results and the political consequences of Article 18.",
    "skills_120w": "Johannes Romeijns specializes in administrative coordination, regulatory processes, and cross-faction diplomacy. His tactical posture favors mitigation and procedural delay over assertion, and he often delegates to stronger allies when crises intensify. Documented limitations include weak performance under pressure, risk aversion, hesitancy in high-stakes moments, and susceptibility to manipulation by ruthless operators like Li Mei. He has no indicated combat abilities, and his effectiveness depends on maintaining legitimacy and process within Stella’s governance environment.",
    "appearance_120w": "Johannes Romeijns is described as of average height and build with limited distinguishing features. He presents with neat professionalism typical of Balance Party elites: formal attire, modest grooming, and non-confrontational body language suited to institutional settings. Under stress he exhibits subtle tics such as shivering or working his jaw. The dossier offers no specifics on hair or eye color, emphasizing demeanor over physical detail and his ability to move through bureaucratic environments without drawing attention.",
    "relationships_180w": "Johannes Romeijns is entangled with figures who shape his choices. With Li Mei, he maintains an uneasy alliance: he respects her capability but is unnerved by her ruthlessness, relying on her for a covert plan that strains his ethics. With Councilor Nhan, he has a collegial link whose rupture—Nhan’s disappearance—signals systemic failure and catalyzes his reactive strategy. With Stella, he sustains a reverent trust in governance rules and fears destabilization, making legitimacy and process central to his decisions. These ties expose a pattern of dependence and proceduralism: he seeks balance, avoids confrontation, and chooses mitigation over assertion, yet crosses a line by authorizing the disappearance of three councilors to delay a vote. The relationships collectively define a leader caught between duty and fear."
