    "summary": "Demmy is an INFJ teenager from the wildlands whose life was defined by skerv survival before finding shelter and belonging in Fox River. The dossier presents him as deeply intuitive and perceptive, exceptional at reading people and threats, and capable of extreme violence when necessary, though not without emotional cost. Cleaned and nourished after Fox River, he trained as a TRiGgers trainee and at times wore robes as an initiate in the Divine Order of the Sanctifying Flame. His first romantic relationship with Evelyn awakened hope and connection. The destruction of Fox River and Evelyn’s apparent death left him emotionally shattered and, at times, catatonic, struggling with grief, guilt, and fear of returning to a feral existence. He values survival, protection of those he cares about, and a longing for meaning, stability, and redemption. The dossier frames his current state as uncertain but emphasizes his capacity for resilience.",

    "bio_200w": "Demmy is a traumatized INFJ survivor from the wildlands who moved from feral skerv life to brief stability in Fox River before the city’s destruction. He is deeply intuitive and perceptive, unusually skilled at reading people and threats, and capable of extreme violence when required, though the emotional cost lingers. Cleaned and nourished, he trained as a TRiGgers trainee and at times wore the robes of an initiate in the Divine Order of the Sanctifying Flame. His first romantic relationship with Evelyn offered hope and connection beyond mere survival. The destruction of Fox River and Evelyn’s apparent death left him emotionally shattered and, at times, catatonic. He values survival, protection of loved ones, belonging, and meaning, while struggling with trust and suppressed grief. The dossier defines him by coiled vigilance, resourcefulness, and a longing to avoid sliding back to the skerv existence he escaped.",
    "arc_200w": "Demmy is a former skerv whose arc traces from kill-or-be-killed pragmatism to fragile belonging in Fox River and collapse after catastrophic loss. Before the pivot, he adapted through ruthless survival tactics while nursing warped but persistent ideals shaped by his mother’s teachings. Fox River provided safety, community, and training, and his bond with Evelyn awakened his capacity for love. The pivot is the destruction of Fox River, which extinguished his refuge and left him grieving her apparent death. Post-pivot, he is emotionally paralyzed at times, haunted by memories, and afraid of returning to the feral life he despises. The dossier emphasizes uncertainty about his future yet points to inherent resilience and a search for meaning that could guide a slow recovery, potentially galvanized by any news about Evelyn.",
    "skills_120w": "Demmy is highly skilled in hand-to-hand combat and improvised weapons, favoring blades such as modified scissors and a long stiletto. He excels at evasion and stealth in the wildlands, reads people and threats with precision, and improvises under pressure. His tactics prioritize survival and rapid decisiveness when alone, supported by rigorous compartmentalization to stay functional. Limitations include PTSD and hyper-vigilance, suppressed grief that can trigger outbursts, a ruthless streak under survival pressure, difficulty trusting others, fear of backsliding into skerv life, and catatonia after Fox River’s fall.",
    "appearance_120w": "Demmy is a lean teenager with deep hazel eyes whose look transforms across two phases. Pre–Fox River, he is wiry and emaciated, hair long and matted, skin patchy and scabbed, teeth decayed, wrapped in rags and a tattered poncho. Post-cleansing, his face fills slightly, hair is trimmed short and light blonde, skin is healthier with visible scars, and his teeth are repaired. He carries himself with coiled tension and alert reserve, often checking for his stiletto. He wears simple, clean TRiGgers trainee clothing or the robes of a Divine Order initiate.",
    "relationships_180w": "Demmy’s closest relationship is with Evelyn, his first real romantic partner who represented hope; her apparent death devastated him. With Quincy, he shares a trauma-forged alliance marked by mutual respect and his protective instinct. With Chase, trust is emerging through shared experiences and mutual regard. Fox River functioned as his first true home and family, giving him belonging and stability before its destruction. These bonds expose his INFJ pattern: rare vulnerability, intense loyalty to the few he lets close, and a readiness to take violent action when he believes there is no other path. The loss of Evelyn and Fox River destabilizes these foundations, leaving him to fight despair while clinging to values of protection and meaning."
