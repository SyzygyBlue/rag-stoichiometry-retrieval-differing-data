    "summary": "Werner is a hyper-competent, emotionally withheld cameraman, drone operator, and forensic photographer formerly affiliated with StellaNet. He values proof over ideology and processes trauma through meticulous work, using drones and layered data capture to frame and analyze scenes. His eyes are fully synthetic—perfect silver disks etched with “Nikon”—that shutter during drone operation while he sees via two micro fly-eye drones. He is tall, pale, lean, with wild curls and a disrepaired, loose-fit wardrobe, often shielding his eyes from light with a clipboard. Personality notes stress cynicism, precision, privacy, and social reserve. Fox River’s destruction transforms him from background technician to frontline witness; his surviving recordings form a rare evidence trail. Post-event, he is alive but strained, a nomadic operator with damaged yet salvageable rigs, surviving with Alejandro and Shelly and positioned to investigate what happened and why.",

    "bio_200w": "Werner is a StellaNet cameraman, drone operator, and forensic photographer who prioritizes proof over ideology. He is methodical, precise, and emotionally withheld, processing pain through taskwork and documentation. His fully synthetic eyes—silver disks etched with “Nikon”—shutter to solid silver during drone operation while he sees through two micro fly-eye drones. Tall, lean, pale, and unkempt, he favors loose clothing and the background, often shielding his eyes from light with a clipboard. Fox River’s destruction moves him from backend technician to reluctant frontline witness whose recordings form a rare evidence trail. Post-event he remains alive yet strained, a nomadic operator with damaged but salvageable rigs, surviving with Alejandro and Shelly. The dossier emphasizes a justice-through-data ethic: he frames, captures, and verifies rather than theorizes, and his detachment masks survivor guilt that now fuels an investigative drive.",
    "arc_200w": "Werner is a behind-the-scenes documentarian whose worldview is transformed by witnessing Fox River’s fall. Before the pivot he excelled at structured capture and analysis, avoiding improvisation and visibility. The catastrophe forces proximity to horror, turning his camera from routine reporting to evidence gathering essential for accountability. He becomes a reluctant witness, his surviving footage and layered reconstructions among the few records of the event. In the aftermath, StellaNet’s collapse leaves him institutionless and mobile, his rigs damaged but repairable. He survives with Alejandro and Shelly, facing the choice of fading into obscurity or continuing as a truth-teller in a hostile landscape. The dossier frames his forward motion as investigation-first: pursue verification, map what happened and why, and maintain chain-of-evidence discipline despite trauma and resource scarcity.",
    "skills_120w": "Werner’s core skills include multi-platform drone operation, forensic photography, and high-fidelity data capture/transmission. He builds tactical mind maps using overlays of temperature, audio, and motion vectors, and he operates mind–machine interfaces and advanced scanners. He excels at verification and reconstruction over improvisation. Limitations include dependence on cybernetics for vision, inability to use his own eyes and drone vision simultaneously, and difficulty in fluid social or moral situations. Emotional avoidance is a risk if deprived of structured work.",
    "appearance_120w": "Werner is 183 cm, angular, and lean, with pale skin and wild, unkempt curls. His eyes are fully synthetic, silver, perfectly circular, etched with “Nikon,” and can shutter to solid silver during drone control. Under stress his face shows micro-muscle twitches. He wears loose, ill-fitting clothes as if borrowed, evoking disrepair, and often uses a clipboard to block sunlight or attention. He avoids eye contact, moves minimally when interfacing with machines, and prefers to stand behind others during interactions.",
    "relationships_180w": "Werner’s closest bond is with Alejandro, his field partner and friend; Alejandro interprets people while Werner interprets systems, creating a symbiotic pairing for reporting and investigation. With Shelly he finds immediate professional alignment and easy cooperation grounded in shared rigor and a data-first ethic. These working relationships stabilize Werner after Fox River’s destruction, offering both logistical support and ethical ballast as he shifts from observer to investigator. The dossier notes survival and continued movement together, positioning the trio to follow leads and protect the integrity of records amid institutional collapse. Werner’s trust is hard-won and narrowly granted, but once given, he contributes discipline, documentation, and analysis that others rely on to navigate crisis."
