    "summary": "Lenya Tam is a young overseer and implied co-owner of the Calum-Tam Holdfast, a slave-holding enterprise tied to her father, Dinh Tam. The dossier describes her as commanding, pragmatic, emotionally guarded, and quick to confront, using intimidation and a constant sidearm to enforce order. She values control and efficiency over morality and treats people as assets or liabilities. Fascination with Chase shifts her behavior: she shields him and Quincy at times and challenges subordinates like Carl, but later, upon discovering deception, she orders a near-fatal beating of Chase and threatens Quincy. Chase shoots her in the final confrontation while escaping. In the ensuing collapse, ravagers sent by Makko overrun the holdfast to erase ties to a broader plan involving Giles Montague. Lenya’s arc closes with ambition unmet; she remains a figure of power without transformation, her death marking a turning point for those who survived her.",

    "bio_200w": "Lenya Tam is an overseer of the Calum-Tam Holdfast, a slave-holding operation tied to her father, Dinh Tam. She is a decisive, commanding ESTJ who enforces order through intimidation, rapid decisions, and a constant sidearm. The dossier characterizes her as pragmatic and emotionally guarded, with a volatile temper kept under tight control. She treats people as assets or liabilities and prioritizes efficiency over morality. Fascination with Chase alters her behavior: she shields him and Quincy at times and confronts subordinates like Carl, yet later orders a brutal beating of Chase after discovering duplicity and threatens Quincy. In the final confrontation during an escape attempt, Chase shoots her. Ravagers sent by Makko subsequently overrun the holdfast to erase inconvenient links to a wider plan involving Giles Montague. Lenya dies clinging to the illusion of control, emblematic of ambition without transformation.",
    "arc_200w": "Lenya Tam is an heir-enforcer whose arc begins with disciplined dominance inside a patriarchal holdfast. Raised to equate worth with control, she seeks to uphold order and prove herself to Dinh Tam. Chase’s arrival creates a strategic fascination: she protects him and Quincy when it suits her aims and imagines leverage beyond the holdfast. That gamble fails when she discovers deception, responds with punitive violence, and threatens Quincy. The pivot is the final confrontation at Holdfast: Chase shoots her while escaping. As ravagers sent by Makko erase the compound tied to a larger scheme involving Giles Montague, Lenya’s authority collapses. Post-pivot there is no transformation—death ends her ambitions. The dossier frames her as nearly changing yet never crossing the threshold, leaving a cautionary imprint on survivors who witnessed the costs of control untempered by conscience.",
    "skills_120w": "Lenya Tam demonstrates firearms proficiency with a pistol and uses it as both tool and symbol of authority. She leads operations with direct command, enforces discipline through intimidation, and confronts peers and subordinates without hesitation. Her tactical strengths are coercive control and rapid, decisive action. Limitations include impulse surges when challenged, a habit of underestimating others—especially due to interest in Chase—loyalties that skew judgment toward her father’s interests, and isolation as the power structure falters.",
    "appearance_120w": "Lenya Tam is a lean, strong young woman with upright, assertive posture and sharp, symmetrical features reflecting mixed Korean and Anglo-Saxon heritage. Her almond-shaped eyes are dark, narrow, and alert. She projects authority through deliberate movements and a lower-pitched, clipped voice. She first appears in a hand-tailored blue dress, sometimes barefoot in the Holdfast yard, then shifts to fitted, homemade utility clothing, often dust-smeared or sweat-stained, with a low-slung pistol on her belt.",
    "relationships_180w": "Lenya Tam’s ties revolve around leverage and control. With Chase, the connection is an antagonistic magnetism: she shields him and Quincy to harness his potential, then turns punitive after discovering deceit and threatening Quincy, leading to her being shot by Chase during escape. With Quincy, she recognizes a rival presence whose survival can regulate Chase’s loyalty; confrontation escalates to a direct threat. With Carl, a subordinate, she imposes discipline through violent dominance to maintain order. With Dinh Tam, her father, she seeks approval while rejecting his limitations, and the family’s authority underpins her position in the holdfast. These relationships chart her shift from calculated protection to overreach, ending in collapse as external forces eradicate the compound."
