- Arrogant: He believes in his own superiority and dismisses the concerns of those he deems less important.

**Physical Description:** Cervantes Adlawan is a 57-year-old Filipino man, standing approximately 5'8" (173 cm) tall with a medium build, neither athletic nor frail. His posture is upright but relaxed, signaling authority without aggression. He is a man used to commanding rooms through silence more than volume.
He has salt-and-pepper hair, predominantly black with streaks of silver at the temples, cut short and conservatively styled with a modest side part. His face is oval-shaped with a prominent forehead, high cheekbones, and a sharp jawline that’s beginning to soften with age. His skin is medium brown with warm undertones, bearing the light creases and sun damage of someone who’s spent most of his life indoors but occasionally travels.
His eyes are dark brown, deep-set and analytical, often narrowed in judgment or skepticism. When in repose, his expression defaults to a tight-lipped frown, a mouth that rarely smiles but often purses in thought. He has faint crow’s feet and vertical frown lines that deepen during moments of frustration or tension.
He dresses in high-end, minimalist formalwear typical of Metrofederacy Industry Party elites, slate-gray or charcoal synthetic-fiber suits with muted, metallic threading visible only at certain angles. Underneath, he wears a white or off-white collarless shirt, sometimes with a soft mandarin collar or asymmetrical closure. A subtle lapel pin marks his party affiliation.
Occasionally, he favors a bone china teacup or a crystal glass of aged single malt whiskey as a prop during long meetings.
Despite not being overtly intimidating, his precision of movement, minimal gestures, and unreadable microexpressions lend him an aura of control and calculation. He frequently taps his fingers or traces table edges when displeased, tics that betray a coiled tension beneath the surface.

**Flaws & Weaknesses:**
- Ruthlessness: He is willing to sacrifice others, even his subordinates, to protect himself.
- Lack of empathy: He shows little concern for the suffering of those outside the Metrofederacy.
- Arrogance: His overconfidence can blind him to potential risks and consequences.
- Internal conflicts:  While pragmatic, he experiences moments of anxiety and unease about the larger implications of his actions, suggesting an internal struggle between pragmatism and conscience.

**Values & Motivations:**
- Stability: He prioritizes the stability of the Stella AI and the Metrofederacy above all else.
- Power: He is driven by a desire to maintain and expand his political influence.
- Control: He seeks to control situations and people to achieve his desired outcomes.
- Key desires: To maintain the status quo, protect the Industry Party's interests, and secure his own position of power.

**Key Relationships:**
- Romuald Anwar: Initially a subordinate tasked with solving the immigration crisis.  The relationship devolves as Cervantes views Romuald as expendable.
- Giles Montague: A political rival and uneasy ally. Cervantes distrusts Montague but is forced to cooperate with him.
- Li Mei: An informant and potential ally. Cervantes trusts her information and demonstrates a degree of respect for her abilities.

**Combat & Skills:**
- Combat abilities and style: Unknown
- Special skills and expertise: Political maneuvering, strategic thinking, negotiation, persuasion.
- Limitations or weaknesses:  Lacks physical combat skills (implied). His arrogance can lead to miscalculations.

**Character Arc Summary:** 
Cervantes begins as a powerful and confident political figure tasked with resolving a looming crisis — the stability of Stella and the integration of Wildlanders. He operates through calculated manipulation, delegating risk to figures like Romuald while maintaining plausible deniability. His worldview is built on realpolitik, central control, and institutional leverage. As the political tide shifts — driven by Giles Montague’s appeals to compassion and strategic favor-trading — Cervantes finds himself swimming against a rising moral current. Though still formally in power, his influence now depends on his ability to adapt, manipulate sentiment, and outmaneuver a system that is beginning to reward empathy over efficiency.

**Current Status:** 
Cervantes Adlawan remains strategically silent. With the Article 18 rule hidden inside Stella’s rule stack and the Balance Party now responsible for navigating its implications, Cervantes is simply waiting to see how events unfold. Giles Montague has taken the public and political lead, and Cervantes—now fully aware of the risks—intends to let him bear the fallout if things go wrong. As long as Johannes Romeijns and the Balance Party proceed with rules validation, Cervantes’s priority is to stay out of the spotlight, avoid blame, and preserve his influence by not interfering unless absolutely necessary.

**Narrative Status:**
Cervantes remains a powerful operator within the Metrofederacy, but the winds of public and council sentiment are shifting. The destruction of Fox River — though devastating — holds little institutional consequence; it was given a mere 90-second slot on StellaNet. What has changed is not the system, but the emotional optics. Giles Montague's strategic appeal to compassion for Wildlanders is gaining momentum, forcing Cervantes to recalibrate. He is no longer operating in a purely technocratic landscape — emotion and moral optics now matter, and his traditional tools of control are losing traction. Still, he remains dangerous: adaptive, manipulative, and deeply versed in the rules he once helped write.

**Motivation ARC Through the Story:**
- Initial motivation: Maintain the status quo, prevent a forced rules update to the Stella AI, and integrate new citizens into the Metrofederacy.
- Evolution of motivations:  As the situation deteriorates, his focus shifts towards self-preservation and maintaining his own power, even at the expense of others.
- Major turning points and impact of Fox River's destruction:  The destruction of Fox River represents a complete upheaval of the existing order, likely forcing Cervantes to abandon his previous goals and adopt a new strategy for survival in a dramatically changed world.
- Current motivations:  Survival, regaining power and influence in the new world order.
- Future directions: Likely to involve maneuvering for power in the post-Fox River world, potentially through alliances or exploitation of the chaos. His pragmatic nature will likely guide his actions as he seeks to adapt and thrive in the new environment.


**Additional Notes:**
- Cervantes's knowledge of "Article 18 privilege" and other political processes suggests a deep understanding of the Metrofederacy's inner workings.
- His enjoyment of luxury goods, like fifty-year-old single malt whiskey and private hypersonic jets, indicates a privileged lifestyle and access to significant resources.  This access is now likely gone.
- His relationship with Li Mei could prove crucial in the future, depending on her own survival and motivations.
- Strategic Asset: Knows how to manipulate Stella rule updates, policy mechanics, and party infighting.
