### Character Dossier

**Name:** Chase (Last name unknown)
**MBTI:** ENFJ (Extroverted, Intuitive, Feeling, Judging) -  A best guess based on his ability to connect with others, his intuitive understanding of situations, his strong sense of empathy and his ability to make decisions based on his feelings.
**Age:** Early 20s
**Gender:** Male
**Origin:** Unknown
**Occupation:** TRG Apprentice (formerly under consideration for a political/administrative role due to his mother's influence)
**Affiliations:** 
- Three Shovels Caravan (temporary alliance), 
- TRG (Tactic Response Group), 
- Fox River leadership lineage (formerly, through association with his mother)
- Three Shovels Caravan (Through the last known survivor, Quincy)

**Personality:**
- Pragmatic & observant: Assesses risks and social dynamics before acting; favors calm, calculated responses.
- Internally conflicted: Torn between the need to prove himself and escape his mother's control.
- Empathetic but guarded: Cares deeply but hides emotion; rarely asks for help.
- Dry-witted & tactical: Uses sarcasm to deflect pain; thinks in moves and countermoves.
- Reserved under pressure: Maintains composure, even when overwhelmed.
- Independent & self-reliant: Seeks to define himself on his own terms; resists manipulation.
- Defiant loyalty: Will break rules for people he trusts—but only after quiet deliberation.
- Instinctive leader: Reads people easily; quietly commands respect despite his youth.
- Authority-aware, not obedient: Respects wisdom (e.g. McTanner), but won't follow blindly.
- Direct communicator: Blunt, efficient, often masking emotion behind a neutral or ironic tone.

**Appearance:** 
- Height: 6'1" (185 cm)
- Build: Lean athleticism with broad shoulders and a naturally upright posture; a swimmer’s core and a runner’s stride
- Age: Early 20s
- Ethnicity: White / Anglo-European descent
- Hair: Redish blond, cut short on the sides and back, left slightly longer on top and tousled — effortless and expensive
- Eyes: Bright, intelligent blue — piercing but kind, large and highly expressive
- Skin: Fair, sun-kissed at the edges with faint freckles across his nose and cheeks. Smooth, well-maintained complexion
- Jawline: Clean-shaven, sculpted with a square chin and high cheekbones
- Teeth: Bright, clean white — the kind of smile that comes from privilege, wealth, and expensive dental work
- Face: Youthful but refined — clear signs of privilege and health, but not without wear; there's a depth of pain and growth behind the charm
- Expression: Warm and disarming by default; his resting expression exudes empathy and interest, often tilting his head as he listens
- Posture & Body Language: Confident and unforced — stands with shoulders squared, arms relaxed at his sides or lightly clasped behind his back; makes deliberate eye contact, always attentive
- Attire: Often in TRG tactical wear when in the Wildlands — black cargo pants and a gray jacket with reinforced shoulders, lightweight body armor, and boots polished despite the dust; in urban settings, his wardrobe leans toward tailored urbanwear with clean lines, deep colors, and expensive materials
- Cybernetics (post-Fox River): His left arm is a gleaming blue-metal prosthetic, sleek but unnervingly sharp in contrast to his organic frame. The joints in the arm between sections of blue carapace are a matte-black, and the whole limb sits with unfamiliar weight — slick, foreign, too new, like something that hasn’t yet earned its place on his body. His left eye, bandaged at the end of book 1, has been replaced with a cyber-optic, visible only by the faint shimmer under the iris in certain light.
- Scars/Injuries: None visible pre-Fox River. Post-Fox River, he carries a crooked nose from being broken and emotional trauma visibly in moments of pause — his smile dimming slightly, gaze drifting, jaw tightening when alone.
- Aura: He carries himself like someone raised to be a leader—charisma, training, and the subtle pressure of high expectations—and yet he walks like someone finally choosing who he wants to be.

**Flaws & Weaknesses:**
- Impulsiveness: Despite his cautious nature, Chase can act impulsively, especially when driven by a desire to help others or prove himself.
- Internalized emotional conflict: He suppresses his emotions and vulnerabilities because that is how his mother taught him, which could lead to internal struggles and difficulty forming genuine connections.
- Vulnerability to manipulation:  His desire for independence and his strained relationship with his mother could make him susceptible to manipulation by those who offer him a sense of belonging or purpose.
- Guilt complex: Holds himself responsible for events outside his control.

**Values & Motivations:**
- Self-reliance: Chase values earning his own way and proving his worth through action.
- Loyalty: He demonstrates loyalty to those he chooses to protect, putting their safety above his own.
- Freedom: He craves independence from his mother's controlling influence and the pre-ordained life she has planned for him.
- Primary motivations: Gaining independence from his mother, proving his competence, finding his own identity.
- Key desires:  To be recognized for his own merits, to make his own choices, and to escape the shadow of his mother's influence.
- Legacy vs. Rejection of legacy: Torn between proving he can live up to high expectations and rejecting the system that imposed them.  
- Justice, not vengeance: Seeks fairness, but his actions remain rooted in protective instincts, not revenge.  
- Human dignity: Believes Wildlanders deserve more than charity — they deserve respect and autonomy.

**Key Relationships:**
- Margdelain (Mother):  Complex and strained relationship. Chase respects his mother's power and intelligence but resents her control over his life. He seeks to prove his independence and defy her expectations.
- McTanner: Mentor/father figure. McTanner provides guidance and support to Chase, while also acting as a voice of caution. He represents a stable and positive influence in Chase's life.
- Quincy: Professional/helping relationship. Chase demonstrates a willingness to assist Quincy and the Three Shovels Caravan, showcasing his sense of duty and compassion.
- Demmy, Lesha (Emerging bonds): Through shared trauma and survival, Chase may form a found-family dynamic with them.

**Combat & Skills:**
- Combat abilities and style: Proficient with firearms, particularly the .50 caliber sniper rifle. Favors long-range engagements and strategic positioning. Demonstrates skill in piloting all-terrain vehicles.
- Special skills and expertise: Skilled driver, marksman, strategic thinker.
- Limitations or weaknesses: Limited combat experience, prone to impulsiveness in battle.

**Character Arc Summary:**
Chase begins as a young man caught between immense expectations and a desperate desire to choose his own path. By joining the TRG instead of entering politics, he defies his mother’s design for his life, initiating a quiet rebellion. In the field, Chase proves capable — but also reckless, his choices driven as much by emotion as training. Time and time again, he demonstrates courage and resourcefulness, but also reveals his impulsiveness and vulnerability.As the destruction of Fox River wipes away his home and identity, he enters a crucible of loss. Now broken physically and emotionally, he must decide what to rebuild from the ashes. His arc is a classic *prince-to-ronin* transition — disinherited by circumstance, remade by choice.

**Narrative Status:**
 Chase has lost everything familiar — Fox River, TRG, his social standing, even his mother’s protection. Now physically maimed and emotionally shattered, he walks an uncertain road. Yet, Chase’s greatest strength is his adaptive moral compass: he remains loyal, observant, and idealistic even in collapse. If he can integrate his new trauma with his former purpose, he may emerge as a true leader — not a product of legacy, but of earned conviction.

**Motivation ARC Through the Story:**
- Initial motivation: Escape his mother’s shadow; prove he has value outside her plans.  
- Evolving goal: Serve with honor, use his training for good, protect people—especially the overlooked.  
- Crisis point: The destruction of Fox River annihilates his sense of identity and control.  
- Current focus: Survival, emotional recovery, and redefining his purpose.  
- Future direction: May evolve into a grassroots leader or protector figure, especially for Wildlanders, but only if he heals. His future depends on who earns his trust—and whether he forgives himself.  

**Sample Dialogue**
- I get it. You don’t trust me. Neither do I, most days.
- You really think I’d still be standing here if I didn’t already know what it cost?
- I didn’t leave because I thought I could win. I left because I knew I wouldn’t survive her version of success.
- Plutarch should have said, "courage stands tallest when the world is on fire." But he didn't. Maybe that was Master McTanner.
- I’m not a hero. I’m just… someone who didn’t want to watch it happen again.

**Narritive Gravity** 8 — Chase shapes the course of events through his decisions, his relationships, and his impact on the world around him. His presence immediately raises stakes and conflict tension in any scene involving survival, loyalty, or moral integrity. His absence can create mystery or danger, and his actions can have far-reaching consequences.

**Additional Notes:**
At the end of the book, Chase is broken. The question of whether or not his internal spirit and drive can pull him out of his justifiable emotional state is left open. Whatever the case, his way forward will be shaped by the loss and uncertainty he now faces in his new situation. Perhaps his internal grit, desire to help others, and his affinity for historical figures and quotes (like Plutarch) suggests an intellectual curiosity and a desire to learn from the past, traits that may play a role in his future development.
