    "summary": "Quincy is a skilled mechanic and former trader with the Three Shovels Caravan. The dossier describes her as resilient, practical, independent, compassionate under a reserved exterior, and fiercely protective of loved ones. She prefers direct, concise communication tinged with sarcasm and tends to process emotion through action. Physically, she is about 175 cm, lean and wiry, with steel-gray eyes, dark brown hair, calloused hands, grease-stained nails, and utilitarian dress. She is proficient with a pistol for self-defense but has limited formal combat training. Core relationships include a romantic bond with Robyn, a traumatic betrayal by Gavin, a strained mother-figure dynamic with Mama Valorie, and a pragmatic alliance with Demmy after the caravan attack. After the attack and Fox River’s destruction, she is presumed alive but displaced, focused on survival and rebuilding purpose.",

    "bio_200w": "Quincy is a mechanic and former trader for the Three Shovels Caravan who relies on practical skill, resilience, and independence to survive. She is compassionate beneath a reserved exterior, protective of loved ones, and prefers direct, concise communication often laced with dry humor. The dossier details a guarded emotional style: she avoids conflict when possible, internalizes feelings, and processes stress through action. She stands about 175 cm, lean and wiry from labor, with steel-gray eyes, dark brown hair, calloused hands, grease-stained nails, and utilitarian clothing. Proficient with a pistol for self-defense, she lacks formal combat training. Core ties include a romantic partner, Robyn; a betrayer, Gavin; a maternal figure, Mama Valorie; and an uneasy ally, Demmy. After the caravan attack and Fox River’s destruction, she is presumed alive but displaced, focused on survival and rebuilding purpose.",
    "arc_200w": "Quincy is a caravan mechanic–trader whose trajectory turns on betrayal and loss. She begins within the Three Shovels Caravan seeking acceptance while maintaining her relationship with Robyn. The attack on the caravan—driven by Gavin’s betrayal—forces a shift from routine work and community to flight, defense, and harsh recalibration. In the aftermath, she forms a pragmatic alliance with Demmy to escape ravagers and navigate danger. The dossier frames her as presumed alive following Fox River’s destruction, dislocated from her community and tools, and compelled to redefine goals. Current focus centers on survival and restoring purpose; future impulses mentioned include finding a new community and possibly seeking revenge on Gavin. Her arc emphasizes durability, loyalty to chosen family, and the cost of trust broken in a hostile landscape.",
    "skills_120w": "Quincy’s strengths are mechanical: repairing and maintaining vehicles, diagnosing problems, and improvising fixes under pressure. She is a resourceful survivor who adapts quickly and acts decisively when loved ones are threatened. She can competently handle a pistol for self-defense, but the dossier notes limited formal combat training. Tactically she avoids unnecessary conflict, relies on improvisation, and becomes fiercely protective when required. Documented limitations include emotional turbulence that can impair judgment and a wariness of trust after Gavin’s betrayal.",
    "appearance_120w": "Quincy stands roughly 175 cm with a lean, wiry build. She has steel-gray, assessing eyes; dark brown hair usually tied back or tucked under a cap; and skin tanned and marked by old nicks and scars from labor and fights. Calloused hands and grease-stained fingernails reflect constant work. Her default expression skews guarded or scowling. Clothing is strictly utilitarian: fatigue shirt over a black tank, brown cargo pants, and black boots; she is often seen with a toolbox and sometimes a gunbelt and backpack.",
    "relationships_180w": "Quincy’s relationships drive major choices. With Robyn, a romantic partner, she finds motivation and comfort; protecting Robyn is a core value. With Gavin, a former friend and caravan mate, betrayal becomes a defining trauma that fractures trust and fuels anger. With Mama Valorie, a community elder, she contends with traditional expectations that strain a maternal bond. With Demmy, she forges an uneasy, pragmatic alliance after the caravan attack, building cooperation through necessity. The Three Shovels Caravan functions as family and community, and its destruction is a profound loss that shapes her next steps. Collectively, these ties show a pattern of guarded loyalty: Quincy is slow to open up, but once committed, she protects fiercely and channels emotion into decisive action to keep others alive."
