    "full_scene_clean": "Jeb McTanner rubs his temples, replaying Chancellor Margdelain’s profane tirade over comms. Chase had fought alone; medics even used questionable caravan blood to keep him alive because TRG hadn’t packed enough. After venting, Margdelain orders a quadrafan med flier and summarily terminates Chase’s TRG apprenticeship. Jeb believes it’s a mistake but must comply. Medics report Chase and the dark-haired woman will recover; the skerv boy is critical and needs immediate flight to Fox River OR. Jeb authorizes the evac; the quadrafan lifts in a dust cloud toward the south. In the quiet that follows, Jeb checks the sedated woman who keeps clutching a well-kept metal toolbox; her custom, sturdy clothing and overall health set her apart from typical wildlanders. Carson arrives with updates: salvage team inbound; Investigator Liebold en route; second flier later with mechanics and drivers; perimeter set (Group B on watch, A resting); MG barrels shot out; Chase’s rifle needs work; two more .30 cals found in the caravan. Food stores remain off limits. Both men note unsettling mysteries: wide areas of grass pressed flat without vehicle tracks and the absence of the rest of the caravan’s people. A quadrafan descends; Jeb and Carson move to meet Investigator Liebold as the hatch opens.",
    "dense_recap_250w": "After the firefight at the Three Shovels Caravan site, TRG commander Jeb McTanner endures Chancellor Margdelain’s blistering comms tirade about Chase’s solo actions and TRG’s medical shortfalls. She cools only to order a med-flier and to terminate Chase’s apprenticeship on the spot—an order Jeb disagrees with but must carry out. Medics confirm Chase and the unidentified dark-haired woman will recover, while the emaciated skerv boy is in critical condition; Jeb authorizes an immediate quadrafan evac to Fox River’s OR. Examining the sedated woman, Jeb notes her unusually high-quality, custom gear, good health, and fierce attachment to a meticulously maintained toolbox, adding to the mystery of her background. Carson briefs logistics: a salvage team and Investigator Liebold are inbound, another aircraft later with mechanics and drivers; perimeter teams are rotated; machine-gun barrels are shot out and Chase’s sniper rifle needs work; two additional .30 cals are present. Jeb forbids raiding caravan food stores. Both men remain troubled by the site: large swaths of grass are neatly pressed flat with minimal track evidence, and the caravan’s people are largely missing. As sunset paints the sky, the quadrafan carrying the boy departs south, and another flier arrives. Jeb and Carson head through dust and rotor whine to meet Investigator Liebold, hoping for answers to the growing list of unknowns.",
