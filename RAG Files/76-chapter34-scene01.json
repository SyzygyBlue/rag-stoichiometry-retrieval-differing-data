    "full_scene_clean": "Demmy wakes in a bright, antiseptic Fox River medical room to the beeps and whir of machines and the scent of perfume. Three clinicians—a bearded man, a dark-haired woman, and a gray-haired woman with a bun—stand over him in gray robes with stethoscopes and pencils. Startled by an IV tube in his arm, he spirals toward panic. The staff calmly explains and the bearded man injects an anti-anxiety medication into the IV; Demmy focuses on the nurse’s gentle smile as his breathing slows and his body relaxes. They say they repaired or force-regrew damaged tissues and that he has made a remarkable recovery. Demmy asks about Quincy and learns he is safe in Fox River. A letter left for him is produced from the bedside drawer. After he stabilizes, he takes the letter and reads the first line: it is from someone named Chase.",
    "dense_recap_250w": "Demmy regains consciousness in Fox River’s medical ward, hyper-vigilant from years surviving as a skerv. The room is small, glaringly lit, and filled with unfamiliar equipment; the air smells of antiseptic and faint perfume. Three clinicians—a compassionate bearded man, a dark-haired nurse, and a gray-haired woman with a distinct accent—assure him he is safe. They explain that extensive care, including tissue repair and forced regrowth, has restored him. Seeing an IV line in his arm triggers escalating anxiety: shallow breaths, trembling, and the urge to flee. Reading his distress, the team administers an anti-anxiety dose through the IV, guiding him to focus on calm cues until the panic eases. Demmy remarks that such calm would get someone killed in the wildlands, revealing his ingrained survival logic. He asks after Quincy; the staff keeps him oriented and retrieves a letter left in his bedside drawer. When he unfolds it, he reads the opening line and realizes it is from Chase. The scene emphasizes Demmy’s transition from feral vigilance to tentative trust within institutional care, establishes Fox River’s medical capability (including advanced tissue regrowth), and introduces Chase’s note as a catalyst for Demmy’s next steps.",
