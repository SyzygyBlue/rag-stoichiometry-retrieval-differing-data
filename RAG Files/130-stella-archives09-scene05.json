    "full_scene_clean": "The smell hit Shelly before she opened the takeout: butter chicken, garam masala, cardamom, ghee—grief and memory of the night the message came: Randy died. She forced bites down while waiting for Michelle’s promised access. A private-node message arrived with a bare subject string (TT7Lq9qLx75jgj.orionblue.ocherwood.ccnz): the jump point. A second private message followed: subject 23297 and pages of random text—likely the service port and certificate key. Shelly launched her connections toolkit, spun up a virtual tap using a pre-Metrofederacy *nix-style routing schema, static encryption, and Macrobus protocol—outside Stella’s jurisdiction. She color-tagged the tap from a sampled swatch of the food’s creamy orange-gold: “Butter chicken.” Connection established, tunnel up, encryption set. A prompt offered to browse a *nix file server; she agreed and saw a deep trove of raw surveillance data: packet captures, traffic logs, vision stills, heat maps, nested folders—much of it commented. Someone had mirrored a woman’s entire virtual presence before Stella scrubbed the logs. Appetite gone, Shelly thanked her mother under her breath, called her an asshole, tossed the meal into the recycler, and settled onto the couch to start digging.",
    "dense_recap_250w": "Shelly self-triggers a hard memory by ordering butter chicken, the dish she last ate the night she learned Randy had died. While forcing herself through it, Michelle’s off-network delivery arrives in two pieces: an unlabeled jump point (a domain-like string) and, separately, a service port number with a long certificate block. Shelly configures an old-school virtual tap using pre-Metrofederacy *nix-style routing, static encryption, and the Macrobus protocol, deliberately operating outside Stella/StellaNet’s oversight. She color-codes the tap with a sampled swatch from the dish—“Butter chicken”—and brings the tunnel up. A detected *nix file server exposes a vast, organized surveillance archive: raw packet captures, decryption attempts, traffic logs, vision stills, heat maps, and deeply nested folders, many annotated. The set appears to be a complete mirror of a target woman’s virtual footprint captured before Stella’s later erasure. Emotionally conflicted—grateful for the access, bitter toward her mother—Shelly discards the food and immerses herself in the data. The scene turns her pain ritual into an activation ritual, transitioning from grief to analysis and marking the investigation’s concrete re-ignition via Macrobus.",
