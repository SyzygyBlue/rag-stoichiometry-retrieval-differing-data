    "full_scene_clean": "Quincy returns to the gate by the Three Shovels trucks, sweeping a flashlight over pea gravel for blood. In the cold night she finds droplets—likely from the intruder’s broken nose—leading around the motor pool toward a row of Fox River two-seaters. Tire impressions and a darker splatter mark where he cleared his nose suggest he left by vehicle. She curses the silent, high-torque electric motors: she never would have heard it go. She needs to know who took a two-seater and realizes the fastest path is Chase, the chancellor’s son. Though she distrusts him and his mother, she admits he is capable and once risked his life to save her and Demmy. She decides to ask him to identify the driver but resolves he will not accompany her to Broken Bow. Irritated at needing him, she cracks her jar of harsh hooch, takes a swallow, caps it, and sets out to find Chase, assuming he is still awake somewhere.",
    "dense_recap_250w": "Back at the livestock pen gate where the Three Shovels trucks sit, Quincy tracks the intruder by flashlight. Blood droplets in the pea gravel lead around the motor pool to a line of Fox River two-seater electric vehicles. She notes tire depressions and a dark splatter where the man likely blew his nose, concluding he fled in one of the two-seaters. Because Fox River’s high-torque electric motors run silently, she could not have heard him depart. Quincy’s priority becomes identifying who checked out or drove a two-seater at that time. Despite deep mistrust of Fox River’s leadership and of Chase Margdelain personally, she concedes he is resourceful, skilled, and previously saved her and Demmy with sniper fire. She therefore decides to leverage Chase to pull vehicle usage information, counting on his willingness to defy his mother, the chancellor, and to face little risk for doing so. However, she draws a firm boundary: she will not bring him with her to Broken Bow. Frustrated by dependence on someone she dislikes, Quincy takes a bracing drink of the jarred hooch she carries, which momentarily steadies her. With a plan in mind—find Chase and get the driver’s identity—she heads off into Fox River’s night, propelled by anger, pragmatism, and the first tangible clue she has had in days.",
