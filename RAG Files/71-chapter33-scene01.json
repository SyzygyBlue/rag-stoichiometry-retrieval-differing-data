    "full_scene_clean": "Gravel crunched under Quincy's boots as humidity and cicadas pressed on her nerves. Toolbox in hand, she rolled a spent brass casing and pocketed it. Ahead, Chase leaned on a Fox River four-seater in shades, TRG kit and sniper rifle nearby. She accused him of staging the earlier rescue with his mother, called him \"Sparkles,\" and demanded he stop hiding the angle. He removed his sunglasses, admitted his life had been curated by Margdelain, and said helping her was about doing something that mattered and proving he wasn’t just his mother’s son. Quincy cut him off, uninterested in therapy; she only wanted to find her family. With no supplies or transport, she conceded she had no choice but to ride with him. She set a single condition: \"Don’t lie to me.\" Chase agreed. Quincy took the driver’s seat of the four-seater and ordered him in with, \"No more talking. Get in before I change my mind.\"",
    "dense_recap_250w": "On the road the day after her exile, Quincy confronts Chase beside his four-seat cart. Still angry and suspicious after his timely sniper rescue, she accuses him and his mother, Chancellor Margdelain, of manipulation and demands to know his real angle. Chase drops the charm, removes his sunglasses, and, visibly shaken, says he wants to do something that matters and to prove he’s not just his mother’s creation. Quincy refuses the speech, reiterating that she only cares about finding her family. Out of options—low on supplies and facing a long trek—she accepts a pragmatic partnership but on strict terms. She lays down a single rule: no lying. Chase agrees. Maintaining control, Quincy walks straight to the driver’s seat of the Fox River four-seater and tells him to get in. The scene establishes a tenuous truce built on necessity, class tension, and a fragile boundary of truth, setting the pair in motion together despite deep mistrust.",
