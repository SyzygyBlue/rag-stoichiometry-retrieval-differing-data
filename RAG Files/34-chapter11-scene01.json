    "full_scene_clean": "The rifle pressed into Chase’s shoulder like an old friend. Through the high-powered scope a steel plate 1,250 meters away was a speck against the gray horizon. Three clicks windage, steady breath—BOOM. Seven and a half seconds later the plate rang. Ben glanced over. “Don’t tell me you just hit W.O.T.?” Chase: “Yeah, just barely.” They bantered: Ben praised the shot; Chase admitted years of practice with Master McTanner when his mother was never home. Today’s drilling wasn’t just for skill—it delayed a confrontation with Chancellor Margdelain. He poured intensity into more shots until Ben’s rifle fell silent and Ben observed he seemed preoccupied. Chase masked his turmoil, blaming “normal stuff” with his mom. Ben remarked he couldn’t imagine having the most powerful person in Fox River as a mother. Chase collected brass, suggested dropping rifles off. TRG officers nodded as the childhood friends walked, and Chase thought of McTanner—the closest thing to a father. They passed through the small door into the labyrinth of shipping containers that is Fox River.",
    "dense_recap_250w": "On 25 Feb 2186, Chase practices extreme long-range shooting outside Fox River, ringing a steel plate at 1,250 meters with his .50-cal rifle. He and his lifelong friend Ben exchange easy banter about the impressive shot and Chase’s upbringing training under Master McTanner while his politically powerful mother, Chancellor Margdelain, was often absent. Though range time typically clears his mind, today Chase shoots to postpone an impending confrontation with his mother and to assert some independence after years of living at “the end of her leash.” Ben senses Chase’s preoccupation; Chase downplays it, keeping his expression neutral and emotions contained. As they finish, TRG officers—many trained by McTanner—nod in recognition. Chase reflects on expectations and on McTanner as the closest thing he had to a father. He resolves that passive-aggressive delays will end today, then he and Ben carry their rifles back through a small door into the container-stacked labyrinth that forms Fox River, heading toward whatever comes next with Margdelain.",
