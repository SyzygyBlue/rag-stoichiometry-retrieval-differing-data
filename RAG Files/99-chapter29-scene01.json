    "full_scene_clean": "Quincy paces the dorm’s common area—flickering bulb, water pitcher, barred window—while Chase and Lenya sit knee-close, whispering. Jealous, furious, and craving escape, Quincy kicks the wall and taunts them. Lenya confronts her, threatening to send Quincy back to the cells and to drag Chase there too if he interferes. Chase interposes verbally, explaining Quincy’s drive to find her family, and tries to keep the peace. Lenya asserts control: they are not going anywhere yet. She plans to go inform Lesha in the agriculture machine shop and wants them to come; getting an “autopacker” working would help. Before leaving, Lenya softens toward Chase, telling him not to be a hero and promising he’ll be home soon. Quincy, seething but calculating, stays quiet; the power dynamic is clear—Lenya holds the keys, and Chase is playing for time.",
    "dense_recap_250w": "In a Calum-Tam dormitory that still feels like a cage, Quincy watches Chase and Lenya confer at close quarters for an hour, growing resentful and desperate to escape. When Quincy snaps—kicking a wall and mocking their flirtation—Lenya strides over and makes the stakes explicit: Quincy can be sent back to the slave cells, and Chase can be dragged there too if he interferes. Chase tries to de-escalate, framing Quincy’s outburst as grief-driven urgency to find her family. Lenya keeps the leverage and redirects the moment into logistics: she will notify Lesha at the agriculture machine shop, and the trio is to come; fixing an “autopacker” there matters to the holdfast. She pointedly tells Chase not to be a hero and promises he’ll be home soon, then exits. Quincy clamps down on her rage, recognizing that any misstep could cost their relative comfort or worse. The scene clarifies roles: Lenya is gatekeeper and enforcer for Calum-Tam; Chase is negotiating from vulnerability, buying time and cooperation; Quincy is torn between survival discipline and the need to move now. A concrete next step is set—visit the agri shop to address the autopacker—while escape remains deferred.",
