    "full_scene_clean": "In the following days, a torrent of reports arrives from captured devices and documents. The council authorizes a new intelligence committee, though staffing will take weeks. Interim teams continue monitoring several devices still receiving vague, unsettling updates from Ransom Canyon and the Calum-Tam Holdfast. The prevailing theory places Brother Jessop in Ransom Canyon—a notion Margdelain finds preposterous given the city’s hostility toward Fox River and herself. She decides to let the situation simmer to avoid escalation. Then a call comes in; she snaps into her communicator, “He’s being held where?”",
    "dense_recap_250w": "Following the downbelow raid, Margdelain’s office is inundated by an overwhelming flow of data from seized devices and documents. The Fox River council responds by approving a dedicated intelligence committee, acknowledging that fully staffing it will take time. While that structure is assembled, ad-hoc monitoring teams keep watch on several captured endpoints that are still phoning home. Those feeds, though sparse and oblique, consistently reference both Ransom Canyon and the Calum-Tam Holdfast, raising alarms in the Chancellor’s office. Analysts coalesce around a working theory that Brother Jessop has fled to, or is operating from, Ransom Canyon. Margdelain bristles at the idea: the ravager city is openly hostile to Fox River and, by extension, to her leadership. She opts to avoid triggering a confrontation until she has clearer intelligence, effectively letting tensions cool while keeping the taps open. That caution is immediately tested when new information arrives mid-call. The update implies that “he” is in custody somewhere unexpected, prompting Margdelain’s sharp demand into her communicator: “He’s being held where?” The scene closes on her shock and the suggestion that the evolving situation may force Fox River into a faster, riskier response than planned.",
