    "full_scene_clean": "Quincy snapped her pistol up as the door opened and fired the instant she saw a chest. The target staggered but didn’t fall—he wore body armor and had a grenade, pin already pulling. From the far side of the TEG-4, Chase’s handgun barked twice. “Not ravagers! body armor!” Quincy yelled. The grenade clattered inside; noxious smoke billowed, and both began retching. Rough hands cut her seatbelt and dragged her out. Her wrists were bound and a cloth bag went over her head. She kicked and swore until a sharp prick hit her neck; a woozy, floating sensation followed as she was moved—likely onto the back of a truck—then blackness.",
    "dense_recap_250w": "As armored assailants breach the flipped TEG-4, Quincy reacts first, firing point-blank the moment the door cracks. Her round stops the intruder only briefly; his body armor defeats the shot, and he tosses a grenade into the cab. From the opposite side Chase fires two quick handgun shots. Quincy realizes the attackers are not ravagers and shouts a warning about body armor just as the grenade spews noxious smoke. The choking gas rapidly incapacitates them inside the vehicle’s confined space. Unknown operatives cut Quincy’s seatbelt, drag her into the grass, bind her wrists, and place a hood over her head. She senses Chase being handled similarly nearby. During the frisk and restraint, Quincy continues to resist verbally and physically until she feels a sharp injection in her neck. Sedation takes hold—described as a gentle, floating sensation—while she perceives brief movement consistent with loading onto a truck, then she blacks out. The scene escalates the roadside ambush from a firefight into a coordinated abduction, establishing that the hostile force is trained, equipped (body armor, gas grenades), and intent on taking them alive. It closes with Quincy unconscious and the attackers in control, leaving the identity, motive, and destination of the captors unresolved.",
