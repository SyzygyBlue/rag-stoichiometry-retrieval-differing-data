    "full_scene_clean": "Quincy perched on a barstool in a shadowed nook favored by Fox River’s laborers. She wanted something punishing—“rattlesnake piss” that burned like a road flare—and asked for a straw, showing her bandaged hands. The friendly, gray-templed bartender produced a repurposed jar of harsh, clear homemade liquor and poured her a double. She drank by straw, embracing the astringent burn that evoked caravan nights gambling on the Wildebeest and swigs of puro. A nearby welder asked about her hands; she deflected. Quincy toasted absent friends—especially Robyn—vowing she was coming. The bartender quietly kept an eye on her and later slipped the jar into her jacket as a gift, saying few liked it and that memories sometimes lived in bottles. Quincy paid with a holocred chip (the reader flashing green) and thanked him. On her way out, she regarded the bar—imagining her caravanner friends at the back tables—then left to visit the silent Three Shovels trucks.",
    "dense_recap_250w": "At a blue-collar bar in Fox River, Quincy seeks numbing fire by requesting the harshest liquor available and a straw to accommodate her bandaged hands. The seasoned bartender retrieves a dusty, repurposed jar of clear homemade spirits and pours her a double, warning it isn’t good; Quincy insists. The drink’s bite triggers vivid memories of caravan life—gambling aboard the Wildebeest and swigs of puro—along with the names and faces of friends now missing. A welder tries small talk about her injuries; she shuts it down, preferring silence. She privately toasts Andreu, the rest of the caravan, and Robyn, reaffirming her promise to find them. Sensing her grief, the bartender shows quiet solidarity: he tucks the jar into her jacket “to keep your memories company,” sharing that he, too, carries memories. Quincy pays via holocred (reader yellow to green) and thanks him. Buoyed by the small kindness yet still aching, she steps into the night, deciding to visit the parked, lifeless Three Shovels trucks—symbols of the community and family she’s lost. The scene underscores class-solidarity warmth contrasted with recent political chess: Quincy’s coping, resolve, and the tools she clings to—memories and motion—toward finding Robyn and the abducted caravanners.",
