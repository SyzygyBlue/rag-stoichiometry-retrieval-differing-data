    "full_scene_clean": "Shelly exits Core Medical Archive 17B into gray sky and walks the service path to a plaza and food strip. Her PID pings that the case update and audit trail are open. Hungry and nauseous, she buys noodles and synthetic fishcake at a run-down stall in the Metrofederacy, noting the curated ‘decay’ aesthetic and a delivery drone overhead. Thoughts of Randy’s suffering return; she forces a few bites, then opens her PID. Using a legacy link outside Stellanet, she composes a clinical message to her mother, Michelle: she passed Forensic Investigator III, found catastrophic neurochemistry, falsified neuroject logs, classified the case for indefinite hold under potential malicious action, and vows to find who did it. She adds, “I miss you,” sends it, and sits staring ahead as the steam rises, her hunger fading but the nausea remaining.",
    "dense_recap_250w": "Leaving Core Medical Archive 17B after placing Randy’s case on audit hold, Shelly navigates a sterile-to-city transition: a gray sky, a quiet plaza, and a Metrofederacy food strip. A PID notification confirms: session concluded, audit trail open. She buys a hot bowl of noodles at a deliberately shabby stall, observing the city’s curated dystopia aesthetic. As she eats, intrusive recall of Randy’s exam—neurochemical collapse and forged neuroject logs—triggers nausea. Shelly opens her PID and deliberately avoids Stellanet, selecting a legacy link protocol to contact her estranged mother, Michelle. In a brief, clinical note she reports passing FI-III, outlines catastrophic findings (cortisol spikes, serotonin collapse, dopamine flatline), asserts that logs were falsified and the neuroject altered, and confirms she has filed for an indefinite hold under a malicious-action clause. She promises to find whoever is responsible and closes with “I miss you,” acknowledging emotional stakes without changing her investigative posture. The message is sent. Sitting on a bench, bowl cooling, Shelly’s appetite evaporates while her resolve—and nausea—remain. The scene cements her shift from contained grief to active pursuit, with the legacy channel signaling a need for privacy and trust outside system rails.",
