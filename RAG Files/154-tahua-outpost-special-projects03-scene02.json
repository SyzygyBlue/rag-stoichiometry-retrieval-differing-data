    "full_scene_clean": "“What the hell?” Skree exclaimed, leaping from the couch and accessing her PID. A high-priority, voice-only connection flashed; she accepted. “Skree, we’re under attack!” Culpering’s simulated voice crackled. “You’ve got to get out! Get to the loading docks—I’ve sent coordinates. Run!” An earsplitting boom shook the room; dust fell from ceiling tiles. “Who’s attacking?” “We don’t know—just go!” Gunshots erupted through the line, then silence. Another explosion tremored the floor. One lounge door splintered open. Two massive figures, skin patterned in Dermoweave, burst in, each with a humming ultrasonic combat knife. They grappled, smashing furniture and a carafe of caf. The blue circle on the floor (where Nikomo had been) slid toward the opposite door; it opened and the circle vanished. A Cryodyne-uniformed merc locked eyes with Skree. “What are you waiting for? Run!” Skree bolted, slotting Culpering’s coordinates; an orange path lit the hallway. Automatic fire echoed behind her. At an intersection, two more mercenaries appeared and traded pistol fire; a bullet punched the wall beside her. She dove, rolled, and sprinted, following the right-hand turn. Double doors to loading docks loomed; she slammed through. Chaos: a merc gunned down three dock workers as they fled. Bullets whizzed; explosions rocked the concrete. The orange path veered right, away from fighting. Engines idled at backed-in trucks and vans. At the waypoint’s end a man in blue overalls waved frantically, pointing to a van. “Get in!” Skree scrambled into the back. “Get in the crate!” He indicated a ceramicrete crate; a control panel flashed numbers; a human-shaped depression lined its bottom. “What the hell is this?” “Do you want to live? Get in or we both die!” Gunfire drew closer. Skree, breathing hard, climbed into the cutout. He pressed a button; the door swung shut. His voice came over an intercom: “We have to pass checkpoint scans. It’ll be cold for a second—just to fool thermal sensors.” “What is happening?” The crate sealed; servo whirs and darkness, save for tiny LEDs. Cold, solvent-smelling gas filled the box. Skree screamed and shoved at the lid; it didn’t budge. “Let me out! I can’t breathe!” Vision narrowed; thoughts blurred. Her consciousness faded to black.",
    "dense_recap_250w": "In the Cryodyne lounge inside the Chaos Dreams VR, Skree receives a high-priority voice call from Culpering warning of an attack and directing her to the loading docks via coordinates. Explosions shake the building as armed figures clash—some wearing Dermoweave armor and wielding ultrasonic knives; at least one mercenary in a Cryodyne uniform orders Skree to run. A moving blue floor circle (where Nikomo had been) slides toward a door and disappears. Skree follows an orange navigation path on her PID through firefights and into the loading docks, where a mercenary shoots dock workers amid ongoing explosions. The path leads her to a man in blue overalls at a van who urges her into a ceramicrete crate with a human-shaped depression. He explains over an intercom that brief cold is needed to defeat checkpoint thermal scans. The crate seals; cold solvent-smelling gas floods the interior; Skree panics, pounds the lid, and blacks out. The sequence completes Skree’s coerced exfiltration from the VR facility under fire, with layers of ambiguity: attackers’ affiliation is unclear, defenders and assailants wear mixed identifiers, and the rescuer may be complicit in her containment. The scene ends with Skree unconscious and removed within a sealed crate, consistent with Fay’s overarching orchestration of a forced transfer.",
