    "full_scene_clean": "Lucas wakes at 0645 to a personal Stella alarm: a hovering AR clock only he can see and hear. He dismisses it with a swipe and moves through a Metrofederacy apartment designed around provisioned modules. A multifunctional corner door halos red when unprovisioned and green after a tongue-tap request; a toilet appears, then a shower—each pristine, serviced, and reclaimed after use. Cleaning bots keep the building immaculate; packaging and fixtures are fully recyclable. Lucas appreciates the efficiency; Michelle hates the impersonality and lack of owned items. He showers with personalized presets, receives a towel, and notes a reminder dot in his vision that clears when he drops it in the hamper. Dressing uses a real base jumpsuit with an AR clothing overlay that others with Stella see; Michelle dislikes AR clothes. They embrace and agree to keep working through differences; she asks for a deli bagel and coffee. Randy bounds down excited about a hands-on with a direct plasma-sintering metal fabricator; Lucas sends him for a real hug for Michelle. Lucas checks his SAIR and DIFF report: community service is weak, mentoring in engineering is recommended. He schedules a Finite Element Analysis mentoring session via Stella, notes fitness remains a goal, and worries Michelle’s SAIR may be slipping even as the kids thrive. He exits to a buttonless, Stella-controlled elevator, selects the gym via lingual command, and heads out for his workout and incremental SAIR progress.",
    "dense_recap_250w": "In a Metrofederacy apartment, Lucas begins his day entirely within Stella’s augmented, service-provisioned ecosystem. Personal AR projections wake him; modular facilities (toilet, shower) are summoned by tongue-taps and arrive cleaned and stocked, then retract for servicing. Lucas values the system’s efficiency and recyclability, while Michelle resents its algorithmic sterility and the absence of owned, personal items such as a simple hairbrush. After a personalized shower routine and using AR clothing overlays, Lucas and Michelle reaffirm their relationship despite tensions; she asks him to bring a bagel and coffee. Their son Randy, thriving under Stella’s education, races to a demo of a direct plasma sintering metal fabricator. Checking his SAIR and DIFF report, Lucas identifies “Community Service → Mentoring → Engineering skills” as his biggest gap and books a Finite Element Analysis mentoring session, appreciating how Stella surfaces actionable steps toward career and compensation upgrades. He also notes fitness goals and reflects on Michelle’s difficulties adapting, even as the children excel. Lucas departs in a buttonless elevator, destination set by lingual command to the gym, continuing his deliberate, system-guided path toward advancement and family stability.",
