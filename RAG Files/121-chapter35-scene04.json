    "full_scene_clean": "Lenya and Chase did show up... three hours later. It was early afternoon, and they walked in, side by side. They looked tired but content. Quincy was about to ask about AR glasses when Lesha stepped off toward them.\n\"So, are the discussions going well?\" she asked, wiping her hands on a rag. \"I hope you're getting everything... thoroughly pounded out.\"\nQuincy's eyes went wide, and she turned to face the maintenance panel, suppressing the urge to laugh. She bit her lip, trying to maintain a neutral expression.\nBoth Lenya and Chase looked up, startled. Lenya's cheeks flushed slightly. It was Chase who began nodding as he searched for words.\n\"It's coming along... well, I think,\" he said, cocking his head with an impish grin. \"We wanted to come by and check on you two, see how you're doing.\"\nLesha nodded slowly as if considering.\n\"Lenya, you got any AR glasses Quincy could use?\" Lesha asked.\nLenya, directing a questioning look back and forth between Chase, Quincy, and Lesha, thought for a moment and then began to nod.\n\"Yes, we have a set, but they're not the newest or the most modern,\" she said, tilting her head skeptically. \"What do you need them for?\"\nLesha shrugged.\n\"She needs to pull up manuals, but she doesn't have implants or corneals.\"\nLenya nodded, her skepticism vanishing. Quincy was listening but kept her focus on the maintenance panel, her fingers tracing wires absently.\n\"Okay, I'll go get them,\" Lenya said, returning to the double doors. Chase turned to follow her, but she shook her head. \"Stay here. I'll be back in ten minutes.\"\nChase, Quincy, and Lesha watched as the double doors closed. Chase held his finger to his lips as he jogged over and pushed them open a crack, peering out. Then, he slipped through. Lesha and Quincy looked at each other and shrugged. Seconds later, he returned.\n\"She's gone,\" Chase said, grinning from ear to ear. \"I'm going to die of dehydration.\"\n\"You're supposed to romance her until she lets us go free, not fuck her into donating a kidney,\" Quincy snarled.\n\"Don't I know it,\" Chase said, throwing up his hands. \"She won't tell me who gave the order to have you kidnapped and dropped off here, either.\"\n\"This isn't working, Sparkles,\" Quincy growled.\nLesha had walked up to them, rubbing her forearms, wincing as if she were in pain.\n\"She wants to marry you and pick out curtains, pop out little boss-bitch babies, not set you free,\" Lesha said, flexing her fingers, a scowl forming.\n\"We know,\" Chase and Quincy said together.\nLesha nodded.\n\"Yeah, well I don't recall fucking the enemy into submission featuring prominently in Sun Tzu.\"\nChase rolled his eyes.\n\"We don't have much time,\" he said.\n\"We had a plan,\" Quincy said, suddenly angry, a vein throbbing in her temple. \"I told you we needed to escape and find a way to Broken Bow, or has all that pussy made your brain go soft? I've got to find my family, Chase. You promised you would help me.\"\nLesha shook her head.\n\"Girl, this is a slaver holdfast... they don't make it easy for their property to just walk away. They have dogs, vehicles, guns, and UAV drones. Oh, and they also have traps. They will track you and catch you, and when they do, they'll drag you back and make a loud, messy example out of you. Your plan's got all the bounce of a dead cat,\" she said, her voice flat and devoid of emotion.\n\"Fuck!\" Quincy swore. \"It's how I escaped a ravager camp... it worked there. Demmy and I found a vehicle, got it running, and ran for days. Why won't it work now?\"\n\"I literally just told you,\" Lesha explained. \"If I were you, I'd have Sparkles here keep dicking down the princess, keep her distracted, and who knows, there's still a chance his plan could work. But you need to be looking for options. While our boy keeps Lenya face-down on a mattress, you and I will have unbroken time to use those glasses to start looking. Right now, you need to keep your head down and don't draw unwanted attention.\"\nLesha hissed as she rubbed her wrists.\n\"What's wrong?\" Quincy asked.\n\"Fucking dirty bathtub stims,\" she spat. \"Withdrawals are kicking in — vision's blurring, skin feels like it's crawling with ants. I gotta dose soon, or I'm gonna be in a world of shit. I'll try holding it together until Lenya returns with those glasses. I'll get you set up and started, but then I'm going to have to crash for a while\"\nQuincy patted the merc on the shoulder, nodding.\n\"Thank you,\" she said.\nLesha nodded.\n\"When you get to Broken Bow, you really need to look into at least getting corneals, lip mic, aural implants, and a lingual interface. It's ridiculous to have such an incredible disadvantage at virtually everything,\" Lesha said.\nChase nodded.\n\"Absolutely, Quincy, if you can get access to the AR goggles, maybe you'll find something that could give us some leverage; I'm all in for that,\" Chase grinned. \"Meanwhile, I'll do the hard work of keeping Lenya occupied so you have room to work.\"\nLesha laughed.\n\"You're a god damned hero, Sparkles. I think I still got access to merc infoboards; maybe I can put you in for a meritorious service medal.\"\n\"I'm sorry, I must protest,\" Quincy guffawed, \"It doesn't count if Miss Bossypants is still upright and mobile. It isn't proper fucking if she can still walk.\"\n\"Whoa, ladies, it's about finesse,\" Chase said, laughing. \"This is a marathon, not a sprint.\"\nBefore Quincy could notice, the Sykotiq injector was already in Lesha's hand. She jabbed the needle into her thigh, then lowered herself onto a mechanic's stool.\n\"Lenya should be here with the glasses soon,\" she said. \"Then you need to keep that bitch out of here as much as you can to let Quincy work — and also find you two some leverage. I took a partial dose — you'll be able to wake me. I'll get her started. Need just a little relief.\"\nQuincy's laughter died. She looked at Chase.\n\"We gotta find a way out of here soon. I'll start looking for anything that could help,\" she said softly.\n\"I'll... help you... with that,\" Lesha winced.\nQuincy gripped Chase's upper arm.\n\"We are getting out of here, Chase,\" she whispered. \"Right?\"\nChase nodded, then glanced at Lesha, whose eyes were already lidded.\n\"What about her?\" he asked.\n\"Don't... worry about me,\" Lesha wheezed. \"I'm already too far gone. Get what you need. Get out. Do it any way you can. But whatever you decide, it's gotta be good, or they'll kill you. Find your family, kid. All that matters.\"\nQuincy stared at the double doors.\n\"I gotta get my hands on some of those glasses,\" she muttered. \"Maybe I'll find some in Broken Bow.\"\nBecause I'm going to make it. Nothing can stop me.",
    "dense_recap_250w": "Lenya and Chase arrive at the warehouse hours late, looking satisfied. Lesha immediately asks Lenya for AR glasses so Quincy can access technical manuals, since Quincy lacks implants. Lenya agrees and leaves to retrieve an older set, telling Chase to wait. As soon as she exits, Chase jokes about being dehydrated from their affair; Quincy snaps that seducing Lenya isn’t yielding information about who ordered their abduction. Lesha warns that escape from the slaver holdfast is far more dangerous than running from ravagers: guards have dogs, vehicles, guns, UAV drones, and traps, and escapees are made into examples. She advises a two-track approach—Chase keeps Lenya distracted while Quincy uses the glasses to search for leverage and options, staying inconspicuous. During the discussion, Lesha’s stimulant withdrawal spikes; she describes crawling-skin and blurred-vision symptoms, then partially doses herself with a Sykotiq injector and sits to ride it out, promising to get Quincy started when Lenya returns. Quincy reaffirms the mission to reach Broken Bow and find her family, squeezing Chase’s arm for commitment. Lesha urges them not to worry about her and to make a decisive, effective plan or risk being killed. The scene ends with Quincy determined to obtain AR glasses and hunt for leverage.",
