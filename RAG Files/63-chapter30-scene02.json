    "full_scene_clean": "In darkness beside the Three Shovels trucks, Quincy searches under the Gooch using the dim glow of Chase’s palm datapad. As they talk about Chase’s mother pulling political strings and his on-again TRG status, Quincy finds a torn, grass-stained note implying ravagers took the caravan to Ransom Canyon’s slave markets. Chase insists the note is planted propaganda to redirect blame away from the Metrofederacy and urges her to put it back so the planters don’t know it was found. Furious, Quincy replaces the note and vows to leave Fox River for Broken Bow to hire a cryptowitch, even selling the trucks if necessary. Chase pleads to go with her and leverage his privileged access to gear and transport; she refuses, accusing him of the same narrative games as his mother. She leaves Chase shaken and alone.",
    "dense_recap_250w": "At night near Fox River’s motor pool, Quincy and Chase investigate the Three Shovels truck called the Gooch. Using the dim light of Chase’s palm datapad, Quincy discovers a torn, water- and grass-stained paper hidden under the chassis. The message, partially missing words, claims ravagers took the caravan to the slave markets at Ransom Canyon. Chase immediately reads it as planted evidence designed to steer public perception—saying his mother, Chancellor Margdelain, needs Fox River aligned with the Metrofederacy and is rewriting events for political advantage. He tells Quincy to put the note back so the people who staged it won’t realize it has been found. Quincy, enraged by manipulation and the risk the planted clue posed to her life, replaces it but resolves to leave as soon as she has transport, planning to sell the trucks to fund a cryptowitch in Broken Bow who can actually trace what happened. When Chase asks to join her and offers to use his ‘honored TRG’ status to secure a vehicle and weapons, Quincy rejects him, accusing him of smoothing realities to make politics work. She orders him to handle his own problems and departs, leaving Chase emotionally gutted and heading back to his room alone.",
