    "full_scene_clean": "Inside the quadrafan, Werner goes fully linked—motionless but streaming structured telemetry to Shelly’s PID. After long quiet, a faint, warm signature appears 700 meters northwest of the blast epicenter under tin-roofed barn debris. Shelly isolates it: viable survivor. Alejandro hovers the quadrafan and remote-hoists wall sections with a rope; Werner ties secure knots and helps clear wreckage. Shelly hears a faint plea for help. Working through beams and twisted tin, they expose a young woman—Evelyn—alive, thirsty, shaken. Shelly asserts doctor authority, performs a brief physical assessment, controls fluids, and keeps the patient still. Evelyn explains she’d gone out during a comms blackout to message Demmy, hid in the barn when rain started, then everything exploded. On Shelly’s PID, Alejandro flags that Demmy, Quincy, and Chase are on a circulated bounty. Shelly asks if Evelyn knows them; she confirms and references Calum-Tam Holdfast captivity. To prevent panic, Shelly withholds the truth about Fox River’s condition, administers a mild sedative and analgesic, promises to inform Demmy, and supervises a stretcher load into the quadrafan. They lift off, Evelyn sleeping, a tiny embroidered yellow dandelion rising and falling on her chest.",
    "dense_recap_250w": "Werner conducts an immersive IR sweep while linked through his ocular processors, silently feeding Shelly tagged telemetry. A faint heat source appears beneath collapsed barn debris roughly 700 meters northwest of the Fox River blast epicenter. Shelly classifies it as a viable survivor. Alejandro uses the quadrafan as a hoist, Werner secures rope and assists, and Shelly directs a careful extraction. Beneath layered beams and tin they uncover Evelyn—conscious, dehydrated, bruised but neurologically intact. Shelly asserts clinical control, limiting water intake, assessing motor/sensation, and preparing transport. Evelyn reports a comms blackout; she had gone out to message a boy named Demmy, took shelter in a barn when rain started, and the explosion followed. A message to Shelly from Alejandro notes a bounty naming Demmy, Quincy, and Chase. When asked, Evelyn confirms she knows them and states Quincy and Chase were held at Calum-Tam Holdfast and that Demmy left to help. To avoid panic, Shelly avoids describing Fox River’s ruin, sedates Evelyn lightly, and arranges evacuation by quadrafan using a stretcher and med kit. As they ascend, Shelly watches Evelyn’s breathing and notices an embroidered yellow dandelion on her shirt—an image of fragile life amid devastation.",
