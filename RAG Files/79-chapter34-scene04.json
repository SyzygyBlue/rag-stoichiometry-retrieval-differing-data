    "full_scene_clean": "Days passed as Demmy grew stronger through daily physical therapy, the exercises lengthening and intensifying. Brothers Olafsen and Ernesto visited to talk and pray, all of them anticipating the first day he could attend a service. Regular meals put weight back on him. They spoke often of the wildlands: Quincy’s water filters, basic first aid, food—simple gear that kept people from needless deaths. Demmy, once one of those wildlanders, shared his experience without graphic detail and wished to forget—or make it better. The brothers said God understands; sometimes bad things happen so good can triumph. They described the Divine Order of the Sanctifying Flame forming missionary groups for the poor, sick, and starving, while acknowledging the scale of need. Demmy warned the ravagers would ruin everything. Ernesto indicated the sword-and-flame emblem; Olafsen said they would aid the innocent and, if it were God’s will, rain holy fire on the ravagers—sacrifices for the greater good. Demmy, practiced in ruthless survival, hoped God could forgive the harms he’d done to live. If the Order could change the wildlands, they could count on him. Asked about loyalty to Quincy and Chase, he affirmed it and would go if needed, but for now he believed the wildlands needed him more. He weighed Chase’s letter and decided he would follow its instructions only if he found something bad enough—so bad it would outweigh the good he saw in the Order.",
    "dense_recap_250w": "As days pass in Fox River, Demmy’s PT ramps up and he gains strength and weight. Brothers Olafsen and Ernesto periodically visit, pray, and discuss the Order’s plans to deploy missionary groups to help the wildlands’ poor, sick, and starving. Demmy recounts how basic gear like Quincy’s water filters and first aid made survival possible; he is tortured by how many die for lack of such basics. The brothers frame suffering within divine purpose and introduce the Order’s dual ethos: mercy for innocents and uncompromising violence toward ravagers—symbolized by their sword-and-flame emblem. Demmy’s wildland pragmatism resonates with this doctrine; he hopes for forgiveness for past necessary harms and decides the Order could be a force for change. When Ernesto asks about his loyalties, Demmy declares he remains loyal to Quincy and Chase and would go if they needed him, but believes the wildlands need him more now. Privately, he calibrates a threshold: he will act on Chase’s warning letter if he uncovers something sufficiently terrible, but otherwise intends to support the Order’s mission. The scene ends with Demmy aligned—cautiously—with the Order’s humanitarian-and-militant program while holding a personal moral tripwire.",
