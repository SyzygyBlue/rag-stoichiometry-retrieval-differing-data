    "full_scene_clean": "The land is quiet: red dirt in every direction, cracked and level, scrub grass twitching in the wind. A whippoorwill calls without answer. Behind a half-buried rock, in a shallow cradle of earth and ash, a communicator chirps—a single bright tone—then again. The device lies under leaves and roadside trash: sun-bleached plastic, a balance weight off an old road tire. Nearby stands a crude cross—two sticks bound with twine—leaning like a quiet apology, its shadow stretched across a small mound in the late afternoon sun. The communicator chirps once more, then falls silent. No footsteps. No voices. No answer. Only wind, dust, and a message undelivered, waiting for someone who will not return.",
    "dense_recap_250w": "On a desolate stretch of red-dirt country, a lone communicator intermittently chirps from beneath leaves and trash tucked behind a half-buried rock. The landscape is empty: scrub grass moves in the wind, a whippoorwill calls without reply. Beside the device, a crude roadside cross made of two twined sticks leans over a small mound, its shadow long in the late-day sun—a minimal marker that suggests a hasty burial and loss. The communicator’s bright, small tone repeats and then fades to silence. No one arrives. No footsteps or voices break the stillness. The scene offers no names, no faces, only artifacts and absence: a message queued but undelivered, a grave with no mourners, and a stretch of forgotten land that will not answer back. The epilogue crystallizes themes of isolation and aftermath—the human traces of catastrophe distilled to a pager-like chirp and a handmade memorial—implying that whoever might have been meant to receive or send the message is gone or cannot return. The moment fixes a mood rather than plot progression, closing on the unresolved thread of an unanswered call and the mute testimony of a cross in dust.",
