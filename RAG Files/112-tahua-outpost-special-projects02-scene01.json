    "full_scene_clean": "Gods, they're beautiful. The hexagonal tessellation on the mercenaries’ bare skin moved like a hypnotic dance. Fay, imprisoned by Li Mei, let her mind roam: a few SCALPEL scripts cut through countermeasures and opened the mercenary dojo cameras. Desire pooled as she watched one fighter’s fluid, brutal grace, imagining Dermoweave skin and enhanced muscle under her touch. Her assistant’s antiseptic voice snapped her back. Jejune—yet another of Li Mei’s rotated spies—stood placidly in a regulation jumpsuit. Fay killed the projection and faced her with a sneer. Behind Jejune, a holo showed Skree’s incubation chamber: the nude clone submerged in gel; other sacks hung like frog eggs. Skree’s full-immersion tri-D life was almost over; release was near. Jejune asked if adulthood took only three years. Fay said yes—slightly more for Skree, as the old woman had no job until now. In sim, Fay had scripted a bogus employer (Cryodyne) so Skree could crack secure comms for Li Mei as practice. Jejune asked about the neuroject and the corpus callosum interface. Fay explained: a third lane to whisper programming—neurochemical nudges, subtle pulses—“a persuasive inner voice.” Invited to see, Jejune logged into the tri-D feed. Smiling, Fay joined a nearly identical feed and began deploying an enhanced malware: scripted behavioral packages delivered via tri-D. She hummed as phase one kicked off, certain she could entertain Jejune until full delivery. In three months, the woman’s mind would shatter. Fay was only sad she wouldn’t be there to watch.",
    "dense_recap_250w": "On July 9, 2186, Fay—confined by Li Mei—illicitly accesses a mercenary training dojo’s cameras using her SCALPEL scripts. Aroused by the sight of Dermoweave-armored fighters, she indulges voyeuristic fantasies before an interruption: Jejune, the latest of Li Mei’s rotated minders, arrives. Behind Jejune, Fay maintains a private holo of Skree’s incubation pod and a cluster of additional clone sacks. Fay confirms Skree’s development took a little over three years and that Skree has lived entirely inside a full-immersion tri-D simulation, recently “employed” by a fictitious Cryodyne to practice cracking secure communications for Li Mei. When Jejune asks about control mechanisms, Fay explains her corpus-callosum interface and neuroject: a ‘third lane’ that whispers programmable suggestions via neurochemical and electrical cues. Playing genial expert, Fay invites Jejune to view the sim and sends the feed address. Simultaneously, Fay logs into a near-identical stream and deploys an upgraded tri-D–borne malware composed of scripted, encoded behavioral payloads. She notes Li Mei rotates handlers to prevent compromise and that Stella’s countermeasures supposedly block Fay’s methods, though in practice they do not fully. As the first deployment phase begins, Fay anticipates Jejune’s eventual mental collapse within three months, satisfied that the bait has taken while Skree’s release into the outside world approaches.",
