    "full_scene_clean": "Carl retreats from the courtyard seething after Lenya’s public reprimand. Quincy, watching, notes that Lenya has ordered her and Chase moved to better quarters. A guard pulls Chase from the line and orders Quincy to stand beside him; Chase is battered but stoic. The guard insists on taking them to get cleaned up and on dropping Chase at the infirmary—safer while Carl cools down. As they move out, guards stay tense. Quincy memorizes the route, weighing escape and danger, and re-evaluates Chase as tough and “dangerous” in ways she hasn’t decided are good or bad. They climb wooden steps and follow a suspended boardwalk; Quincy glimpses the holdfast wall only ~30 meters away and, in the other direction, spots Carl watching them with murderous intent. She pretends not to see him, mind racing with fear and possibility.",
    "dense_recap_250w": "After Lenya’s confrontation with Carl, Quincy is ordered—along with battered Chase—into relocation. A guard, acting on Lenya’s direction, yanks Chase from the slave line, positions Quincy beside him, and leads them away, insisting Chase must visit the infirmary both to heal and to avoid Carl’s immediate retaliation. The courtyard remains on edge, guards’ hands near weapons. As they cross wooden steps and a suspended boardwalk, Quincy catalogs every turn for a potential future escape while privately resolving to cover Chase’s back. She weighs whether Chase’s ‘dangerous’ quality is the kind that helps or harms and recalls past violence with Gavin, as well as distant thoughts of her lover Robyn. Near the boardwalk, a gap between buildings reveals the perimeter wall—freedom tantalizingly close at roughly 30 meters. In the opposite direction stands Carl, staring with undisguised malice. Quincy masks that she’s seen him and keeps moving, concluding Carl’s hatred will make Chase a target at the first opportunity. The sequence sets a new status: transfer toward an infirmary/new quarters, a reinforced death-threat from Carl, and Quincy’s sharpened intent to watch routes and opportunities.",
