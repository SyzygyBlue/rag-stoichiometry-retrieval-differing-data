    "full_scene_clean": "The two-seater, a scavenged marvel of patched metal and repurposed parts, tore across the plains with newfound ferocity. The steering pulled hard to the left, a constant battle Quincy fought with gritted teeth. Catching the caravan was her only option — she refused to consider any alternative. For now, speed was paramount, as was avoiding any ravagers faster or better armed than they were.\nShe mounted the solar panel on top as before. Not much to do with the fuel cell except fill it with puro and flip the switch. The catalyzer mesh inside was dark with residue instead of the expected golden sheen, hinting at its poor condition. The little generator sputtered, coughed, then sputtered again. Quincy held her breath, exhaling slowly as it finally chugged to life. A grin touched her lips; it produced only a trickle of current, a fraction of its potential, but better than nothing. She wired it in, then cleaned and tidied all the connections, boosting her confidence that the electrical system would hold.\nWe can't afford a breakdown.\nQuincy wrestled the vehicle around obstacles, the electric motor's hum a welcome contrast to the suspension's rattle-bang. Each bump sent a jarring tremor through the frame, a cacophony of clangs and screeches, like scrap iron tumbling down a metal staircase. Something would break if they kept pushing it this hard, but it didn't need to last forever.\nWhat if we never catch them?\nThey had to make it. She refused to think otherwise.\nDemmy scanned the horizon with the binoculars as they rumbled over the grasslands. He lowered them, his gaze meeting Quincy's as he bounced in his seat.\n\"You know, this is a ravager rig,\" Demmy yelled over the roar of the wind and the vehicle's rattling, \"when we get to the caravan, what's to stop your guys from shooting us on sight?\"\n\"I've been thinking about that,\" Quincy yelled back, \"We'll have to find some way to signal them. Maybe we can scavenge something useful along the way. A radio would be ideal.\"\nDemmy shrugged, unconvinced. He lifted one leg, revealing a foot wrapped in filthy rags.\n\"A pair of boots that fit would be nice, too. I've got small feet, so if you happen to see any footwear lying around beside that radio...\"\nDemmy's lips curled into a wry smile.\n\"And, since we're dreaming, I'd like to put in an order for a whole new wardrobe. Preferably ravager threads, you know? Wouldn't hurt to blend in,\" he suggested with mock seriousness as the two-seater bucked like a wild horse, tossing them in their seats.\nQuincy arched an eyebrow. She gave a short laugh.\n\"Yeah, okay, smart guy.\" She grinned. \"We'll keep a look-out all the same.\"\nIn the far distance, beside a stand of trees, she saw a palisade, buttressed with a shorter stone wall, became visible. Quincy knew they'd be noticed; their dust cloud was surely visible for kilometers. Yet, given their distance and size, she doubted they'd be considered a threat. A lazy curl of smoke rose from the encampment. From this distance, crops appeared as patches of green outside the walls. No livestock were visible, likely hidden within.\n\"Holdfast,\" Demmy said, gesturing with the binoculars towards the distant walls.\n\"Yeah,\" Quincy agreed, \"Pretty sure the caravan trades there. The head man's name is Rodrigo...or something. Doesn't matter.\"\nShe frowned, glancing back at the holdfast.\n\"We're ravagers to them. Their snipers wouldn't hesitate to fill us with holes if we get in range.\"\n\"Let's not do that,\" Demmy said, shaking his head with a raised eyebrow, \"I don't need any more holes. Can't keep the one I got fed.\"\nQuincy wrestled the two-seater across the uneven terrain, her fingers clutching the dirty steering wheel. Soon, the landscape morphed into endless grassy plains. Quincy focused on steering, dodging obstacles as they devoured ground at a reckless pace. Rough spots tested the suspension, threatening to rattle their teeth loose, but the two-seater held together.\nAfter another half hour of hard driving, they spotted three more battle-damaged ravager vehicles, disabled and abandoned in the distance. One four-seater, a burned-out husk, still sent tendrils of black smoke curling into the sky.\n\"Probably haven't been picked over,\" Demmy grunted as their vehicle pitched, jolting over a hidden obstacle. He rubbed the top of his head and winced. \"Might be able to get a few more supplies...and my bones could sure use a break.\"\nQuincy shook her head. If they reached Three Shovels, those supplies wouldn't matter. They'd have everything they needed then. She kept the two-seater rolling southward. The world dissolved into a blur of green and brown, the plains a canvas streaked by their reckless speed. Quincy's expression was set in a mask of concentration as they tore across the open countryside. The wind whipped her face, leaving a dusty, gritty residue she could taste. Her throat was parched, and when she reached for water, Demmy handed her a flask. They were making the best time since this crazy journey began. She wasn't about to slow down now.\nFour more wrecks. Quincy noticed them but made no move to adjust course or speed. Demmy said nothing at all. A while later, her gaze darted to the battery indicator, her fingers drumming a nervous rhythm against the steering wheel. Anxiety tightened in her gut.\n\"Hey, can you check the meter on the charger and read the level?\" she asked, her voice tight with tension.\nDemmy twisted in his seat, tilting the small meter clipped to the charging wire. He squinted at the reading, then turned back around.\n\"Sixty-two,\" he reported.\nQuincy nodded. The spare batteries were taking a good charge. Not surprising, given the bright sun and few clouds. They might get two full days of running at this speed before needing to take charge days. She had no idea how far away the caravan was, though the fresh, often still-smoking ravager wreckage told her they were on the right track.\nQuincy kept the drive motor at near full power, settling in for a couple more hours of the bumpy ride. They'd made excellent progress in the new two-seater. In their all-out sprint, they were moving much faster than the caravan could. Periodically, she had Demmy check the drive motor's temperature. Warm, but not hot — acceptable. She kept them rolling, determined to push on until low charge forced a battery swap. The thought that fueled her: every second they weren't in pursuit was a second the caravan — and Robyn, was drifting further away.",
    "dense_recap_250w": "Quincy and Demmy push a scavenged two-seater ravager rig at near full power across open grasslands to catch the Three Shovels Caravan. The vehicle pulls left and the suspension rattles, but Quincy keeps speed paramount. She mounts a solar panel and coaxes a puro-fueled catalyzer generator to life despite its dark, fouled mesh, wiring it to trickle-charge spare batteries. Demmy raises a critical risk: arriving in a ravager rig could get them shot by their own people; Quincy decides they need a way to signal, ideally a radio scavenged en route. They spot a distant walled holdfast with crops and smoke but avoid approaching, knowing snipers would view them as ravagers. Along their route they pass multiple fresh, battle-damaged ravager wrecks—proof they’re on the caravan’s trail—yet Quincy refuses to stop for supplies or rest. Dust stings, the wind roars, and the battery meter reads 62 as the sun helps charge. Quincy monitors drive-motor temperature and commits to redline pace until a forced swap, believing every second matters to close the gap to the caravan—and to Robyn. The scene emphasizes technical improvisation, misidentification danger, and love-driven urgency.",
