    "full_scene_clean": "The TEG-6 hummed across the wildlands while Demmy stared out at red dirt and scrub. He fingered the small communicator Evelyn had given him and finally opened three unread messages: she hoped he wasn’t mad, confessed growing feelings and fear, and said she needed him—restless and incomplete without him. The tenderness crushed him. Looping images of Fox River’s destruction and Evelyn’s smile shattered his faith; he tried to pray and failed. He thought about asking Quincy to turn back to see the ruins but stayed silent, hiding Evelyn from the others. Lesha’s bulletproof resilience intrigued him, but grief suffocated his curiosity. During a brief stop, Demmy slipped behind a low ridge, laid Evelyn’s communicator on cracked soil, fashioned a tiny cross from two sticks, and covered it with dust and leaves. “I’m sorry. I should’ve never left. I was supposed to die there with you,” he whispered. He returned wordlessly to the TEG, resolving that, in Evelyn’s name, he would find a Bible and search for meaning in the loss.",
    "dense_recap_250w": "Riding in the TEG-6 across barren wildlands, Demmy grieves Fox River’s annihilation and the implied loss of Evelyn. He fingers the small communicator she gave him and, after resisting, reads three queued messages: she asks where he went and hopes he isn’t angry; admits intense, scary new feelings and asks him to come back; and longs for him physically and emotionally, saying she feels incomplete without him. The revelations devastate him. Demmy’s internal monologue recounts his past as a skerv and the brief belonging he found in Fox River, now erased. He wrestles with a collapsing faith, trying and failing to pray, wondering if anyone—or God—was listening. He considers asking Quincy to turn the vehicle back so he can witness the destruction himself, but decides against it and doesn’t tell anyone about Evelyn. During a short stop for Quincy and Lesha, Demmy slips away, places Evelyn’s communicator on the ground, constructs a small cross of sticks beside it, and gently covers both with dust and leaves, creating a makeshift grave. He apologizes aloud and returns without a word, resolving to find a Bible when they arrive and search for meaning in suffering and loss.",
