    "full_scene_clean": "She floated up from sleep, warm and weightless. In her dream, she traced the outline of his face, a familiar landscape etched in her memory. She wasn't ready to wake. She remained under her covers, recalling his piercing eyes, a shocking depth for such a young soul. Demmy, an ocean of complexity in a world of shallow puddles. Being near him was intoxicating. Rolling onto her side, she reached for her shirt on the floor and brought it to her nose. Inhaling deeply, she caught the scent of sandalwood and spice, mingled with the dust of crawlspaces. A happy sigh escaped as she dropped the shirt and stretched, breath hitching at the memory of his kisses. She licked her lips, recalling the taste of him, the way his mouth had moved against hers. Shivers traced her spine. The fire blooming in her belly coexisted beside giddy waves that threatened to wash her away. She wanted to squeal and kick her feet like a schoolgirl. Yet a knot of anxiety tightened in her chest, a counterpoint to the lingering euphoria. It was a dizzying loss of control, exhilarating and terrifying in equal measure. One part of her wanted to slow down, the other to plunge headlong into the unknown. It felt... unsafe.",
    "dense_recap_250w": "On November 27, 2186, Evelyn wakes in a private room and lingers between sleep and memory, immersed in the sensory afterglow of time spent with Demmy. She recalls his eyes, the complexity she perceives in him, and the intoxicating pull of his presence. Small physical actions—bringing her shirt to her nose, inhaling sandalwood and spice mixed with dust from crawlspaces, stretching under the covers—reinforce a vivid, intimate atmosphere. Memories of kissing emphasize mutual closeness and desire. Alongside this euphoria, an anxiety knot forms: the relationship’s speed and intensity feel like a loss of control. Evelyn experiences a clear, internal split—part of her wants to slow down and protect herself; another part wants to surrender to the momentum and plunge forward. The scene contains no external interruptions, decisions, or overt plot mechanics; instead, it captures a concentrated, interior moment where exhilaration and fear coexist. The final note lands on ambiguity and caution: the connection feels thrilling but unsafe. This snapshot establishes Evelyn’s emotional baseline toward Demmy, flags a looming tension between desire and self-protection, and sets up future choices about pace, boundaries, and risk in their developing relationship.",
