    "full_scene_clean": "Quincy walks along a rocky gravel road, Fox River’s comms tower still barely visible behind her. She has pulled the bandages off her healed hands and stuffed them in her jacket pocket. She carries her familiar toolbox, a .45 automag on her hip, a few nearly-empty holochips, three ration bars, and a mostly-full water bottle. Broken Bow Free City is at least three weeks away, and she feels doomed. She shouts at the emptiness about being kicked out of the whole city for “one little punch,” blaming Margdelain and mocking Chase’s “mommy issues.” Rage rises as she considers throwing the useless holochips, but she stops and pockets them. Thinking of Robyn and the caravan, she feels crushed with guilt and forces back tears to conserve water.",
    "dense_recap_250w": "Exiled from Fox River, Quincy sets out alone on a rocky road with minimal supplies: a toolbox, .45 automag, a handful of nearly-empty holochips, three ration bars, and a mostly-full bottle of water. She removes her now-healed hand bandages and notes the risk of sunburn. Broken Bow Free City lies no less than three weeks away, making her situation dire. She vents at being expelled—“one little punch”—and lays blame on Chancellor Margdelain while deriding Chase’s dependence on his mother. Despite a flare of rage that tempts her to throw away her meager holochips, she retains them, recognizing scarcity. The emotional core is survivor’s anger and despair colliding with grit: Quincy believes the caravan is gone, Robyn is lost, and she bears the blame. Tears burn but she refuses to waste water. The scene cements her isolation, resource constraints, and determination to keep moving toward Broken Bow despite long odds.",
