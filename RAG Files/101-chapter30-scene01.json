    "full_scene_clean": "At 2000 hours Demmy receives a hot meal in his church dorm room—he’s told to stay in to “study,” but he suspects they simply don’t want him wandering. While finishing the food (including a sweet spiced purple drink), he hears insistent tapping near his dresser where Chase’s note and scavenged tech are hidden. A whisper identifies itself as Evelyn. On her instructions he silently slides the dresser; a vent grate opens and Evelyn wriggles through, grinning and carrying a canvas bag with dark, prowling clothes. Demmy changes, awkward about modesty; Evelyn averts her eyes, then gently frames his wildlands past. She finds his scavenged datapad and a cracked camera. Demmy explains the pad came off a ravager he and Quincy killed and warns her not to open any pictures or recordings—ravagers do horrific things. She asks to borrow the datapad; he agrees but pleads again that she avoid media on it. The two share a long, careful hug and brief kisses. Evelyn, thrilled and mischievous, tucks the datapad into her bag, climbs back into the vent, and invites Demmy to follow. He enters the service ways behind her, surprised by how quickly his world is changing.",
    "dense_recap_250w": "Confined to a church dormitory under the pretense of ‘study,’ Demmy receives his dinner and notes he’s being kept from roaming. A close tapping leads him to a hidden vent behind his dresser. Evelyn emerges via the grate, explaining she knows the service ways from childhood and has brought a canvas bag of dark clothes suited for sneaking. Demmy changes, and the two negotiate a tender, cautious intimacy—acknowledging Demmy’s survival-hardened life while observing new boundaries. Evelyn spots a ravager’s datapad and a cracked camera he had hidden; Demmy reveals the datapad was taken during a fight he and Quincy survived and warns her not to view any images or recordings because ravagers document atrocities that could scar her. Evelyn, exhilarated by the risk, asks to borrow the datapad; Demmy agrees on the condition she avoid media. They embrace, share brief kisses, and coordinate a covert excursion through the vents. Evelyn slips back into the duct and beckons Demmy to follow, framing it as an ‘adventure.’ The scene establishes Demmy’s restricted movement, Evelyn’s insider access to the building’s service corridors, the existence and potential danger of the ravager datapad, and the emergence of a trusting bond that may enable clandestine movement and information-gathering.",
