    "full_scene_clean": "Quincy\nThey had been driving for an hour without seeing a soul. They had agreed to stop, to see to Chase's wounds. Lesha had sworn she was no medic, but in the end, she had more experience than anyone else. And so now Quincy was leaning against the TEG-6, watching Lesha wrap a bandage around Chase's straightened arm. At least it didn't have a bone sticking out.\nFox River hadn't messed around when they loaded this vehicle. Med supplies, arms, ammunition, combat engineering (Quincy just called it shit that blew up), even one of his favorite rifles. They had stuffed everything in the back. Lesha injected Chase with antibiotics and painkillers before straightening the bone. Might as well have left the painkillers out. Chase just screamed until he passed out.\nWhen Lesha finished her treatment, Quincy asked for the meds. Lesha pulled the painkiller from her pocket. Quincy smiled politely as she put the vials back in the medkit. She didn't miss how Lesha watched her. Please don't be a problem. You're amazing, Lesha. Let's get you to Broken Bow and find you some help. But what treatment was there for Sykotiq addiction? Tie a motherfucker to a tree?\nQuincy did not see anybody tying Lesha to a tree. She had walked into 9mm SMG fire and snatched the gun out of Gavin's hand like she was taking a bag of sweets from a child.\nShe was worried about Demmy. He hadn't said a word. She needed to talk to him, but what to say? Poor guy had finally found a home. He wore that pendant, so she suspected religion. And she thought he'd found a girl. Now, nothing... again. She wasn't a source of comfort. Lesha? Even worse. Chase would be best, but he was in no shape to help anyone. She wanted him to know it would be alright. But would anything really be alright? And who was The Blacklight Syndicate Gavin and Lesha mentioned? She needed to get ahead of that and find out what they were all about before they were being bit in the ass again.\nThen Quincy sighed and thought about Chase. Her opinion of him had almost done a 180 since their abduction. And while it was shitty to admit, now that his mom was dead, she might start trusting him a little more. It surprised her when she thought of him as a friend back when she was knocking a hole in the cell wall, but she realized it was true. She just hoped he could get past all this tragedy. She already knew she planned to stick with him... help him through it. That was the way caravanners worked. She smiled when she realized that that was exactly what he had been doing for her this whole time. We'll get you through this, Sparkles. Then, we're going to find the sons of bitches that took our families from us.\nA chill went up Quincy's back, and she realized she had just made another promise, probably just as unwise as the one she had made Demmy. She realized that had only been a few weeks ago. But she meant this one just like she meant Demmy's. It did not matter that she had not said it out loud. It mattered to her.\nLesha was waving her over to the cot where Chase lay in the sun. His chest rose and fell steadily. Lesha was wrapping tape around his arm. \"Let's get him in the backseat,\" Lesha said as she tore the tape off and tossed the remainder of the roll in the medkit. Quincy nodded and they carried him and placed him as carefully as they could. They placed him in the vehicle. His forearm was still wobbly at the break, but at least it wasn't bent at odd angles or oozing blood.\n\"How is he?\" Quincy asked.\n\"He won't die... for now\" Lesha said, \"But there's still dirt and debris inside his arm, and antibiotics can only do so much. By the time we get there, he may need a cybermancer more than a doctor.\"\n\"Nothing we can do about it right now. We need to be rolling,\" she said and climbed into the driver's seat. When everyone was in, the TEG-6 accelerated, making its way to Broken Bow Free City.",
    "dense_recap_250w": "After an hour’s drive without encountering anyone, Quincy calls a roadside stop so Lesha can perform field triage on the gravely injured Chase. Using the well-stocked TEG-6 medkit, Lesha injects antibiotics and painkillers, straightens Chase’s fractured forearm, and bandages and tapes it; he screams through the reduction and then passes out. Concerned about Lesha’s Sykotiq addiction and recent behavior, Quincy politely but firmly takes possession of the remaining painkiller vials and returns them to the medkit. While watching over the procedure, Quincy reflects on Demmy’s stunned silence after Fox River’s destruction, suspects his faith and a lost relationship are involved, and worries about the ominous Blacklight Syndicate mentioned earlier. Her view of Chase has shifted since their abduction—she now regards him as a friend and quietly vows to help him heal and pursue those responsible for their families’ deaths. Lesha warns that dirt and debris remain in the wound and that Chase may ultimately need a cybermancer. Quincy and Lesha load Chase into the back seat, and Quincy gets them moving again in the TEG-6 toward Broken Bow Free City for medical help.",
