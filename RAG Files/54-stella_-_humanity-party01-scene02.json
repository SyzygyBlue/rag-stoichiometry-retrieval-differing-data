    "full_scene_clean": "Cervantes Adlawan rides Industry’s hypersonic jet on a suborbital arc toward Thórsmörk Palace, sipping a fifty-year-old single malt and rehearsing his defense. He broods over Giles Montague’s push to admit a billion new citizens using coerced behavior auditors, believing those altered would never recover. He resolves to distance Industry from Humanity’s plan and, if needed, sacrifice Romuald Anwar to contain fallout. He recalls meeting Li Mei of the Balance Party—signaled by chocolates—and learning that Montague has already built an off-books operation on a tiny Pacific island, hemorrhaging holocreds and contracting Blacklight Syndicate. After today’s meeting, when Romuald was out of the room, Giles offered extravagant trades for Article 18 sealing; Cervantes accepted, though he fears exposure. He wonders who in Balance will sign and dreads the imminent Balance deliberation blackout. Looking up at the stars through the vanishing canopy, he records a guarded statement—no longer in a Faraday cage—that something bad is happening. He cannot stop it, only perfect his story so Stella cannot pin blame on him.",
    "dense_recap_250w": "Alone aboard Industry’s hypersonic jet, Cervantes Adlawan reflects on the clandestine deal he just made with Giles Montague. He hates the coercive auditor plan—believing those pressed into service will be ruined—but, after Humanity offered extravagant trades, he agreed to help seal it under Article 18 while Balance reviews rules in a communications blackout. He plans to shield Industry by distancing from Humanity and, if necessary, letting Teragen’s Romuald Anwar take the blame. From Li Mei of Balance, who contacted him via a prearranged chocolates signal, Cervantes learned Humanity already erected an off-books facility on a tiny Pacific island and hired Blacklight Syndicate, burning holocreds to operationalize the scheme. He questions why Giles would risk Stella’s stability and two billion citizens to save a billion at the cost of a hundred thousand coerced auditors. As the jet arcs back to Thórsmörk Palace, he uses the jet’s vanishing canopy to gaze at the stars and mutters a carefully worded remark “for the record,” aware Stella can hear him now. He resigns himself to damage control: survive the Balance blackout, perfect the narrative, and ensure any blowback misses him—even if that means sacrificing an ally.",
