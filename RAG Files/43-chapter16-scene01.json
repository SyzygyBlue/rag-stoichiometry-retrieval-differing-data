    "full_scene_clean": "Chase wakes to antiseptic sting and pounding pain. He lies on a bullet-pocked med bus, not Fox River, an IV dripping beside him. Memory flashes of a ravager’s face make him shudder. A low alto voice warns him to stay still—the woman from the machine-gun nest. She names herself: Quincy. He asks about the gaunt kid with wild blond hair; Quincy says TRG flew him out on a quadrafan for emergency surgery—Demmy—if he lives. Chase introduces himself; Quincy grudgingly thanks him: “We’d be dead if you hadn’t.” Wind whistles through the perforated window as Chase fades, but Quincy pushes: she must find her family. Trucks were here when she arrived; everyone else was gone. She repeats the story McTanner wouldn’t accept: she was separated roughly 200 kilometers away, fought back in a stolen ravager two-seater with Demmy, returned to find an empty camp. Agitated, she pounds metal, railing that McTanner thinks she’s wildlander trash after salvage. She insists the caravan is hers—she knows every bolt and weld—and even points to her own tent and clothes as proof. She hates asking, but needs help. When Chase offers to explain to McTanner, Quincy cuts him off: she speaks for herself. “You want to help? Find my family.” Unless he can do that, she wants silence to think. Exhausted, Chase nods and lets the dark take him again.",
    "dense_recap_250w": "On the morning after the battle, Chase regains consciousness on a bullet-scarred med bus rather than in Fox River. He’s hooked to an IV and barely able to see through swollen eyes. The woman he helped save identifies herself as Quincy; she confirms the emaciated boy—Demmy—was airlifted by TRG on a quadrafan for emergency surgery and may not survive. Quincy needs to locate her missing people. She recounts, again, a version of events McTanner allegedly dismissed: she was separated from the Three Shovels Caravan roughly 200 kilometers away, fought back across the Wildlands in a stolen ravager two-seater with Demmy, and upon arrival found trucks present but no people. She accuses TRG leadership of assuming she’s a scavenging wildlander and asserts ownership and intimate knowledge of the caravan (“every bolt, every weld”), even citing her tent and clothes as proof. While Chase offers to talk to McTanner on her behalf, Quincy insists on her agency—she’ll speak for herself—and sets a condition: if Chase wants to help, he must find her family. Physical cues—the wind whistling through bullet holes, Quincy's pounding on metal—underscore the aftermath and tension. Chase, still badly injured and exhausted, agrees and slips back into unconsciousness. The scene cements the alliance-in-tension between Quincy and Chase, highlights Demmy’s precarious status, and foregrounds the mystery of the caravan’s disappearance.",
