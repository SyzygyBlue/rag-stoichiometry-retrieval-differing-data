    "full_scene_clean": "In blackout darkness, Quincy wakes to a key turning and grips two bricks to ambush whoever enters. She hears Chase breathing steadily in the adjacent cell and steels herself to fight. The door unlocks and creaks open; she prepares to strike—until a whisper identifies the intruder: Demmy. Relieved, she drops the bricks and asks how he got in. Demmy cuts her off, urgently asking where Chase is and whether he can walk. He warns that a mass of ravagers—hundreds—are converging and that the holdfast is about to become a slaughterhouse. He has a six-seater parked nearby and insists they move now, with or without Chase. Quincy refuses to abandon Chase, citing his broken arm and likely rib injuries. Demmy urges speed; Quincy commits to getting Chase up so they can attempt escape.",
    "dense_recap_250w": "Quincy, imprisoned in a pitch-black cell at the Calum-Tam Holdfast, wakes to the sound of a key and prepares to attack with two bricks. She vows not to leave Chase, whose slow, regular breathing carries from the next cell. As the door opens she readies a strike, but a whisper stops her—Demmy has reached her. He immediately asks about Chase’s condition and mobility. Quincy reports Chase is badly hurt, with a broken arm and probable rib injuries. Demmy, tense and concise, states that ravagers—“five hundred, maybe more”—are approaching and that the holdfast will soon be a bloodbath. He has staged a six-seater as close as he can and insists they must go now, “with or without him.” Quincy rejects the idea of leaving Chase, growling that they are not leaving him behind. Demmy urges her to get Chase on his feet; every second counts. The scene ends with urgency and a plan: extract both prisoners to the six-seater before the ravagers overrun the site.",
