    "full_scene_clean": "Chase wakes on a cold metal table under a harsh spotlight, body unresponsive except for his left eye. Music hums distantly; ad panels around the room hawk chrome limbs and synthetic mods. Wires and tubing lace the ceiling. Realization stings: Fox River is gone. Quincy leans into the light—worried, uncharacteristically tender—and tells him a cybermancer needs his consent before treatment. Lesha, calm and steady, backs her up. Chase is immobilized by a nerve block, mind skittering between panic and trust. After Quincy begs, he croaks, “I… I consent,” and relief floods her face before she snaps back into problem-solving mode. The cybermancer shuffles into view: goggles like insect eyes, too-many metal fingers ending in tools, a hookah’s spiced smoke curling as he works. Quincy bristles at the smoke; Lesha’s hand on her shoulder cools the fuse. The cybermancer explains he records consent so patients don’t wake missing pieces they never agreed to lose. He strips the blanket, lays a bleach-wet sheet on Chase’s skin, fits a mask that smells faintly of machine oil and then eucalyptus, and shoos the others to a waiting room. As sedation thickens, the doctor’s segmented hands slot new tips with tiny clicks. “Don’t fight it,” he murmurs. “You have good friends.” The fog closes over Chase; darkness takes him as the procedure begins.",
    "dense_recap_250w": "In a gritty clinic in Broken Bow Free City, Chase regains partial consciousness on a metal table, immobile from a nerve block and panicking. Quincy and Lesha hover nearby, having brought him to a cybermancer for emergency repair. Quincy, rattled but resolute, urges him to grant consent; the cybermancer refuses to operate without recorded agreement. Chase, recognizing Quincy’s worry and trusting his friends, finally says he consents. The cybermancer—a spidery figure with goggled eyes, multi-jointed cybernetic hands tipped with surgical tools, and a hookah sending spiced smoke into the air—prepares the operation. Tension spikes when he blows smoke in Quincy’s direction, but Lesha de-escalates and keeps Quincy focused on Chase. The cybermancer lays a bleach-soaked sheet on Chase, fits a breathing mask that shifts to a calming eucalyptus scent, and begins swapping tool heads while explaining that consent prevents disputes when patients wake to unexpected losses. He dismisses Quincy and Lesha to a waiting room and sedates Chase, who slips into darkness as the procedure starts. The scene centers on consent, vulnerability, and loyalty amid body-horror tech: Quincy’s awkward tenderness, Lesha’s steadiness, and a clinician whose ethics coexist with clinical detachment and grime. Outcome: surgery commences; Chase’s fate and extent of augmentation remain unknown.",
