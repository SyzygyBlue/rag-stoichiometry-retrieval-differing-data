    "full_scene_clean": "The pod rises with a hiss; cold mist curls across the vault floor as seals disengage. Lights adjust. Randy lies in the capsule, preserved yet ruined: paper-thin skin, collapsed cheeks, jutting clavicles, curled fingers. Shelly steadies herself, then triggers her prepared FI-III checklist overlay via PID. She begins First Pass: visual inspection against a baseline wireframe. Amber and red flags populate, including pressure ulcers inconsistent with regulated pod care. Shelly orders a full panel—neurochemistry, tox, musculoskeletal, endocrine—and behavioral sync to biometric logs. Insectile probes sweep; Stella’s toolkit renders a neurochemical deviation map: extreme cortisol spikes, dopamine instability, severe serotonin drop, brainstem alert, and rapid-onset cachexia. PID logs (Level III; personal entries redacted) show incongruously calm neurochems. Cross-checking timestamps returns 27 misaligned entries and a probable data falsification alert. Shelly classifies the case as Potential Malpractice/Intent to Harm, freezes records, and initializes an audit trail with an indefinite cadaver hold. She sends a secure message to her father, Lucas, noting forged neuroject logs and that Randy’s death was not a simple decline. She ends the session, returns the subject to storage, and vows to find the perpetrators.",
    "dense_recap_250w": "In the Sector 4 vault of Core Medical Archive 17B, Shelly begins a structured FI-III cadaver exam on Specimen 291874237—Randy, her 18-year-old brother. A PID-driven checklist and Stella’s forensic toolkit overlay a baseline wireframe and launch a full panel of internal analyses. Visual flags include pressure ulcers that imply prolonged immobility inconsistent with medical failsafes. Neurochemical deviation mapping shows catastrophic cortisol spikes, dopamine instability, steep serotonin depletion, a brainstem alert, and rapid-onset cachexia—signs of acute neurochemical collapse rather than stable decline. When Shelly opens the Level III neuroject logs (personal entries redacted), they depict a calm, pleasurable state. She cross-checks the logs against real-time biofeedback and receives 27 timestamp misalignments and a probable data-falsification alert, indicating synthetic or manipulated entries. Concluding that someone accessed Randy’s neuroject and shut him down while forging logs, Shelly updates classification to Potential Malpractice/Intent to Harm, freezes the record, and places an indefinite hold on the cadaver with an audit trail. She sends a terse, secure update to her father, Lucas, and privately vows to find whoever is responsible. The session ends with Randy returned to storage and Shelly walking out, resolved.",
