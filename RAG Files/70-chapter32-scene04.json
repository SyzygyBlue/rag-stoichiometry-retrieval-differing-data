    "full_scene_clean": "Quincy walked another half hour down a gravel road, cursing under her breath and counting dwindling supplies: no tent, no bedroll, no shovel; three-quarters of a bottle of water; three ration bars. A copse of trees lay ahead—\"Nice place for bandits,\" she muttered—so she loosened the .45 on her hip. She thought of Demmy’s caution, but chose the direct route, lacking time and supplies to detour. A man stepped out with a wire-wrapped baseball bat, grinning. Quincy drew closer, let the pistol hang at her side. A sharp crack and delayed boom split the air; a body with a ruined torso tumbled from a tree. \"Fucking Chase,\" she growled, recognizing the rifle. The batman lunged; a second crack/boom sounded as another gunman fell from the trees. Quincy fired once into the charging man’s chest; he collapsed. She searched the bodies—nothing of value, only junk rifles. Looking back, she saw Chase rising to a seated position, red hair visible, his four-seater closing the distance. Exhausted and furious at needing him, she considered fleeing but knew he had what she needed. She wondered if he had a crush on her and coined a nickname: \"Mr. Sparkly Sunshine\"—too long. \"Sparkles\" would do.",
    "dense_recap_250w": "Alone on the road after her exile, Quincy measures her scarce resources and approaches a tree-lined stretch she deems ideal for an ambush. Despite recognizing the risk, she enters the copse, lacking supplies to take a longer, safer route. A bandit with a wire-wrapped bat confronts her while additional gunmen lie in wait above. Before the fight fully unfolds, two distant, powerful rifle shots—crack followed by a low boom—drop hidden assailants from the trees. Recognizing the signature as Chase’s rifle, Quincy curses. The bat-wielding man charges; Quincy quickly shoots him in the chest with her .45. She searches the bodies but finds only worthless rifles and no valuables. Chase, approaching in a four-seat cart, becomes visible as the immediate danger ends. Quincy is enraged at the dependence and suspects manipulation, yet acknowledges he likely has the transport and gear she needs. She pointedly prepares to make any cooperation difficult and, with bitter humor, assigns him a nickname—\"Sparkles.\" The scene advances their forced proximity: Chase as sniper-rescuer, Quincy as reluctant survivor balancing pride with necessity.",
