    "full_scene_clean": "Quincy threads through Fox River’s stacked shipping-container maze, the smell of oil and paint tightening her chest. She pushes to the southern exit near the caravan storage, passes a sentry, and steps into the cold night under a star-filled sky. Circling the motor pool, she finds the Three Shovels trucks penned in an unused livestock enclosure. A flashlight flickers beyond the trucks. Quincy slips through the oiled gate and closes on a crouched figure. She launches a kick; the intruder absorbs it, clamps her leg, and tries to nullify her strike. Quincy hammers his face with bandaged fists, feeling a nose crunch, but he powers up, dumps her backward, and bolts. She snatches the dropped flashlight, sprints after him around the motor pool, and checks the exit she used; the sentry reports no one passed. Choosing not to alert Fox River, Quincy lies that she’s looking for a friend and backs out to continue the search on her own.",
    "dense_recap_250w": "Pressured by Fox River’s claustrophobic container corridors, Quincy heads for the southern exit to visit the impounded Three Shovels trucks. Outside, the open night and river sounds steady her. At the motor pool’s livestock pen where the trucks sit, she spots a flashlight flicker behind them. She silently opens the well-oiled gate and advances on a crouched intruder. Planning to use her steel-toe boots, she drives a kick that lands, but the man traps her leg and surges upright. Quincy pounds his face with her bandaged hands, feeling his nose break, yet he hoists and throws her, knocking the wind out of her. He flees through the gate to the gravel; Quincy grabs the flashlight and chases, tracking briefly by the dancing beam and a possible blood spatter. Reaching the door she exited earlier, she questions the sentry, who saw no one pass. Deciding Fox River’s response would only slow her, she conceals the encounter, claiming she’s seeking a friend, and withdraws to continue hunting alone. The scene adds a concrete sign of a saboteur or thief near the trucks, confirms Quincy’s hands are healing, and underscores her preference for decisive action and mistrust of institutional help while her only lead vanishes into the night.",
