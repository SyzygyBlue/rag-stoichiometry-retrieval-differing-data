    "full_scene_clean": "Demmy points out the small gate in the wall ahead as Quincy and Demmy haul the badly injured Chase toward it. Lenya intercepts them with four guards, pistol drawn, while distant heavy machine guns and explosions signal a ravager attack on the holdfast. Carl arrives with a club to finish them. Demmy admits he cannot shoot well left-handed. Chase asks for the 10mm pistol, takes it, and—despite barely standing—shoots Lenya in the chest after she taunts him. Carl charges Chase. Lesha appears, denounces Lenya, and decides to walk away from the burning holdfast; as Carl closes to strike, Lesha dives into his thigh and upends him. Demmy slides in and drives his stiletto into Carl’s neck, killing him. With the holdfast burning and guards wavering, Demmy urges immediate escape. Quincy confronts the fallen Lenya to find Lesha’s stims; after pleading from Chase, Lenya points to a hut beside the warehouse (top shelf vials) and, as a condition, rasps that if they see Jessop, they should “kill him dirty.” Quincy retrieves the vials. Demmy and Lesha shoulder Chase and the group flees through the gate as the holdfast burns.",
    "dense_recap_250w": "At the Calum-Tam perimeter, Demmy guides Quincy and the barely mobile Chase toward a small gate when Lenya blocks them with four guards. Distant heavy weapons and fireballs mark a ravager assault engulfing the holdfast. Carl advances to crush the escapees. Demmy, poor with his left hand, hesitates to shoot. Chase, swaying, takes the 10mm and shoots Lenya in the chest after her taunt. Carl charges; Lesha, an ex-merc struggling with stim dependency, emerges from the shadows and declares she is leaving before the heavy weapons reach them. As Carl closes, Lesha tackles him low, flipping him; Demmy slides in and kills Carl with a stiletto to the neck. Lenya’s guards stand stunned; Lesha orders them to help their burning holdfast. Demmy urges flight, warning ravagers will be on them any moment. Quincy demands the location of Lesha’s stims; after Chase’s plea, a dying Lenya points to a hut beside the warehouse (top shelf vials) and adds a condition: if they see Jessop, kill him “dirty.” Quincy fetches the vials. Demmy and Lesha shoulder Chase, reholster weapons, and, half-carrying him, the group exits through the gate, leaving Calum-Tam to burn.",
