    "full_scene_clean": "\"Well, there goes fifty holos,\" Quincy mumbled as she approached their small apartment. The rhythmic banging coming through the walls left little to the imagination. The sun had fully set, and for a moment, Quincy considered just walking back to the warehouse and hanging out with Lesha. But she shook her head with stubborn determination; she was going to get in her cot. She wasn't going to spend her time making allowances for Chase. Sneaking inside and getting into bed without them noticing would be a bonus. Modesty was a foreign concept to her.\nWouldn't be an issue back in the caravan. In a tent city surrounded by trucks, everybody was up in everybody else's business all the time.\nCarefully twisting the door handle, she pushed it open and peered inside. Not spotting either one of them on the couch, she slipped in, carefully closing the door behind her.\nLenya's loud pants became evident once inside.\nDamn, girl, get some.\nWith all the noise, Quincy doubted anyone would notice, but she took soft steps anyway. In the dim light, she accidentally bumped the glass pitcher sitting on the little table. An instant later, it was falling. Heart racing, she managed to catch it just before it shattered on the floor. Her eyebrows shot up towards her hairline. She cradled the pitcher, a sardonic grin stretching her lips.\nThat would have got their attention.\nBlowing out a relieved sigh, she set the pitcher back on the table, more in the center this time, and continued. The sounds of lovemaking were coming from inside the dormitory where Chase slept, the door almost closed. As she passed, she glimpsed Lenya standing, bent over with her hands pressed flat against the wall, her back bowed downward, her head lolling as her hair swung in rhythm with each thrust. Chase was behind her, gripping her hips, giving it everything he had. Quincy grinned, slipping immediately into her own dormitory, thankful she had not been seen. As quietly as she could, she closed the door, grateful for the small mercy of privacy.\nGive her that premium pipe, Sparkles. Get in there, good and deep. Maybe you can fuck our way to freedom.\nQuincy slipped off her boots and out of her clothes — they smelled of dirt and old machine oil, and she was glad to get out of them. Wearing only underwear, she climbed under the covers. She laid on her back, the sounds of fierce lovemaking in the room next door a jarring counterpoint to the silence of her own space. Quincy shut her eyes and tried to think of something else. She was actually grateful when the pace finally picked up, the pitch of Lenya's throaty cries becoming frantic. The whole apartment began to shake. Impressive. Unable to help herself, she grinned in the darkness.\nYou're a goddamned bull, Chase.\nAll at once, Lenya exploded into the high-pitched wails of climax, followed immediately by Chase's cascade of deep grunts and then... silence. Seconds later, she heard them both laughing, the sound muffled by the thin walls.\nIt was the laughing that made her think of Robyn — Robyn, who she used to lay with and bring to climax over and over while the moon made its inevitable trip across the sky. Robyn, who she had not thought about all day. Quincy scolded herself. She missed her.\nGod, it just was not fair.",
    "dense_recap_250w": "Returning at night to the small shared apartment, Quincy hears unmistakable sounds of Chase and Lenya having sex and mutters that she has lost the fifty-holos bet she made earlier. Determined to sleep in her own cot, she quietly enters. In the dim light she nearly drops a glass pitcher but catches it before it shatters, avoiding discovery. As she passes the nearly closed door to Chase’s dormitory, she glimpses Lenya and Chase mid-act, then slips unseen into her own room and closes the door. She strips off oil-smelling work clothes and lies under the covers while the vigorous lovemaking in the adjacent room shakes the apartment. Quincy’s internal commentary is sardonic and practical; she wants rest, not drama. When the noise crescendos to climax and the pair’s laughter follows, it triggers a pang of longing for Robyn, the woman she once loved and pleasured through long nights. The scene ends on Quincy’s private ache, contrasting isolation with the intimacy next door. No overt confrontation occurs; the primary actions are stealth entry, a near-accident with the pitcher, and an internal emotional turn toward memory and loss.",
