    "full_scene_clean": "Brother Simon sat at the info board in one of the deepest, oldest containers in the Fox River stack. He'd been on shift a little over an hour and was already two cups of caf in—any more and he'd be jittery; any less and he'd start falling asleep. Yawning and stretching, he watched the six monitors he was responsible for, periodically making a call, sending a message, or making a note in the log.\nAn indicator for a datapad in the field winked on. That terminal hadn't been online for over a month; a sticky flag read: If this goes active, alert the on-duty supervisor. He tapped his headset and called the supervisor.\n\"This is Elmer,\" a voice crackled.\n\"Hey, Elmer, this is Simon. One of the remote terminals we're watching just went active.\"\n\"Which one?\"\n\"Number sixty-seven. It says it belongs to Hammond.\"\nElmer's tapping bled soft static over comms. \"Yeah. Says Hammond was KIA. Probably some skerv trying to sell it. Do a remote brick.\"\nSimon navigated to the bricking option.\n\"Hold up, have you done it yet?\" Elmer cut in.\n\"About to.\"\n\"Just for laughs, check if location tracking is enabled.\"\nSimon backed out, found a green checkmark. \"Yeah, it's active.\"\n\"Let's see where our skerv has taken it.\"\nSimon pulled up tracking. The map centered on Fox River. Refresh. No change.\n\"Elmer,\" Simon said, voice tight. \"The device is here. It's here in Fox River.\"\n\"Are you sure?\"\n\"It's here. Give me a second—I'll pull details.\"\n\"Tell me as soon as you know. We've got to get our hands on that device—now.\"",
    "dense_recap_250w": "On November 27, 2186, Brother Simon works an early shift at the Fox River container stack operations bay, caffeinated and monitoring six security/telemetry screens. An alert lights up: a field datapad (remote terminal #67) that has been offline for over a month suddenly comes online. A posted instruction to alert the supervisor prompts Simon to call Elmer. Cross-referencing shows the terminal is assigned to Hammond, listed as KIA. Elmer assumes a scavenger (“skerv”) is trying to fence the unit and orders a remote brick. Before Simon executes the permanent wipe, Elmer asks him to check whether the device’s location tracking is active. Simon confirms tracking is on and pulls the map: the datapad resolves to a point inside Fox River itself. After a refresh shows no change, Simon reports the result; Elmer escalates immediately over comms and instructs Simon to get the exact position so they can physically recover the hardware. The scene ends with an urgent retrieval directive and the bricking action on hold, establishing a security incident centered on a supposedly dead operator’s device now transmitting from within the compound.",
