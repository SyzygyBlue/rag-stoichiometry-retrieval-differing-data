    "full_scene_clean": "They followed the tree line until Quincy spotted a shallow depression and hid the two-seater under brush. Battery dropped two notches; recharge later. Demmy led; Quincy followed, night-vision turning the woods ghost-green. Smells of damp leaves, rot, woodsmoke, and faint putrefaction rode the breeze. A small fire glowed—maybe bait. Creeping tree to tree, they spotted a ravager-style two-seater with a kicked-out front wheel and a body face-down nearby. One unaccounted for. Demmy signaled; then sudden struggle—Demmy and an older, stocky man in rags wrestling over a shotgun. Quincy holstered her automag to grab Demmy’s dropped shiv but was knocked back as the man swung Demmy into her. The shotgun began to come around on Quincy; she drew and fired once. The man fell, dead. Silence returned; crickets resumed. Up close, he looked like a starving skerv, not a ravager. Quincy processed the kill—revulsion mixed with a terrifying, clean focus and post-shot buzz. Demmy recovered his shiv, pocketed the casing, and handed Quincy the warm brass while testing the shotgun. He praised her for not hesitating. Quincy holstered the pistol, pocketed the casing, and stood, still buzzing. They turned to see what else the camp and vehicle might yield.",
    "dense_recap_250w": "Quincy and Demmy conceal their buggy and stalk a small nighttime camp using low-light optics. They detect woodsmoke, a too-visible fire, a ravager-style two-seater with damaged steering, and one corpse—implying another hostile nearby. Demmy advances with his shiv and is ambushed by a stocky, older man in rags wielding a shotgun. In the close-quarters fight Demmy drops his knife; when the assailant swings the shotgun toward Quincy, she draws her .45 automag and fires once, killing him. After the shot, the forest returns to quiet. Seeing the body clearly, Quincy realizes the attacker seems more like a starving skerv than a ravager, triggering a hard internal reckoning: she acted to survive, yet the precise, adrenal clarity of the kill felt disturbingly good. Demmy calmly retrieves his shiv, lifts the shotgun, and compliments Quincy’s lack of hesitation, giving her the spent casing to pocket. With the immediate threat ended, they prepare to search the scene and the damaged ravager buggy for salvageable parts in hopes of improving their own vehicle and closing the gap to their caravan.",
