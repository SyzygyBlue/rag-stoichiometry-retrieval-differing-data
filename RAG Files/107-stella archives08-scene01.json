    "full_scene_clean": "The miniature concert hall was cool, sharp, and clean. She welcomed the chill. It licked across her collarbones, tightening her skin. She walked toward the piano like it was an altar. The bench sat centered in the pool of light. The enormous Steinway loomed behind it, wrapped in shadow — massive. Waiting. The keys gleamed like old teeth. Reverent. Daring her.\nShe sat. Adjusted her PID — the hoodie and tracksuit she wore shimmered, shifting into a sleeveless black dress, structured, minimal. Not worn for anyone; there wasn't anybody here. Just respect. For the piano. For the ritual.\nHer concert pianist specification was still active in her SAIR. She kept it up... quietly. Like a Promise. Not that she played in front of people. Not anymore.\nEnvironmental controls:\nHVAC down to 15°C\nLighting: performance override → spotlight only, 15% intensity\nSconces: active, ambient flicker, 5%\nThe room's environmentals adjusted. The temperature dipped. A crisp chill kissed the back of her neck. Good. Cold keeps me sharp.\nShe stepped forward. The bench waited in the circle of light. The keys gleamed softly, ivory lacquer dulled by time and reverence. She rolled her shoulders once, slowly. Flexed her fingers. Tucked one foot behind the other under the bench and sat. Her breath steadied.\nThe selection hovered in her vision: Rachmaninoff. Prelude in C-sharp minor. Her go-to for thinking. Slow. Momentous. Her favorite storm. Rachmaninoff — about Randy's age when he composed this. The thought had come unbidden. Didn't matter. She'd still drop each note like a verdict.\nHer hands hovered over the keys, fingers twitching. Dad hasn't left his flat in more than two weeks. Her fingers thrust down— Boom. Low D-flat. Her left hand struck like a judge's gavel. Boom. Boom. The familiar triplet rolled out like a slow decree. Dad isn't returning my calls. I don't think he's avoiding me. He's just... receding. Becoming a hermit. Slowly disappearing, ever since Mom left.\nShelly inhaled through her nose, exhaled through tight lips, and continued. She brought her right hand down, delicate, hesitant. She slowed the tempo, the melody entering like a whisper, trembling on top of all that power — a question asked in the middle of a storm. I need to visit him soon. There's just so little time. She knew she could have made the time if she wanted to. It's an excuse. Really, I'm just like him. We're fading away; he's just got a head start.\nShelly winced when she missed the next note. The aborted sound echoed through the empty chamber. She sat up, drew a breath, placed her hands back down, and began again. \"Fay,\" she whispered through her gnashed teeth as she hammered down on the next bar. Faces flashed through her mind. Shriveled husks in cold storage. Broken families. Shattered lives. Randy wasn't the only one. There were others. Thirty-two in all. Same profile. Same cause of death. Same falsified logs. Same systemic indifference, quietly filed away under the reason code failure to thrive.\nBut she had the name now. Fay. But Fay was a ghost. A footprint on the wet sand of a thundering beach. The moment Shelly had cracked Randy's journal, the name had appeared. That had been four months ago. Shelly had been tracking her down, cross-referencing, trying to distill from the ether of StellaNet breadcrumbs something concrete — a time, a location, a face. Fay.\nShe had been close. So close. But as of this morning... all of it was gone. Erased without a trace. As if this Fay person had never existed. Thank god I've been vision-capturing everything I've found and forwarding it on to Mom. She'd checked. All of her outmail was still there, off StellaNet. Everything else was wiped. Even Stella's backtraces had nothing. No flags. No logs. Not even a shadow. Someone crawled StellaNet and erased Fay. Who has that kind of access? What kind of clearance gives you that sort of privilege?\nHer left hand dropped into another heavy chord. Her shoulders squared. The tempo pushed forward. The completeness of Fay's erasure belonged to bedtime stories — boogeymen, monsters under the bed. Myths. And yet it was true, nonetheless. Gone. Whoever did it was powerful. But who would spend that kind of energy to disappear the identity of a serial killer?\nThere was something else hidden in the silence — something waiting, just beneath the surface. She didn't know what. Not yet. She sensed that this question was the merest tip of a much larger iceberg looming. But she would need to learn more if she ever wanted to reveal its nature.\nDistracted by her thoughts, Shelly nearly missed another note, a flicker of tension tightening her brow. She tabled this dilemma and played on — no way to answer it now, no sense dwelling on it. The piece was building now. More force, more weight. Her jaw was tight. Sweat on her upper lip, despite the cold. She adjusted her posture.\nSomeone had been hurting these men — hurting and killing them... for years. People like Randy. She willed the thunder to erupt from the big Steinway as the melody danced like rain. Fay's behind it. She could feel it. Couldn't prove it though. Right now, I can't even prove she exists — except for some stupid vision-captures sitting on a wildlander mail node.\nHer fingers climbed the final set of arpeggios, the melody keening above the thunder. She leaned into it. I'm going to find you. Count on it. Whoever she was. Wherever she'd gone. There was no such thing as perfect erasure. Not even Stella could do that. And I'm going to find whoever helped you disappear so that at the very least, I can understand why.\nShelly intuitively knew that would prove to be a much more difficult task, but she had time. She was young. And she was patient. The last three chords rang out — massive, slow, final. Like a tomb door slamming shut. Then: silence.\nShelly sat there, unmoving. The chill of the room curled around her neck, pooled at her feet. Randy. The victims. Her father. Fay. She exhaled, slow and controlled, then stood. Her mind was still, though the keys still hummed beneath her fingertips — echoes of thunder that refused to fade. Her clothes shimmered back to a hoody and track suit. It was time to get back to the hunt.",
    "dense_recap_250w": "In a small, meticulously controlled concert hall on June 13, 2182, Shelly prepares a private ritual to think: she changes her attire via PID, lowers the HVAC to 15°C, dims the lights to a spotlight, and sits at a Steinway to play Rachmaninoff’s Prelude in C-sharp minor. As she plays, her thoughts move through family fractures—her father’s growing isolation since her mother left—and the death of her brother, Randy. She connects Randy to thirty-two other victims with similar profiles and falsified logs labeled \"failure to thrive.\" A single name anchors her investigation: Fay. Shelly discovered the name in Randy’s journal four months earlier and has pursued it across StellaNet, cross-referencing breadcrumbs to pin down identity, time, and place. That trail has just been wiped: as of this morning, all StellaNet traces of Fay are gone, including backtraces and logs, as if Fay never existed. Anticipating loss, Shelly has been vision-capturing findings and forwarding them off-network to her mother; those outmails remain intact on a wildlander mail node. Confronted with the power required for such total erasure, she infers a formidable actor behind Fay’s disappearance and questions why anyone would expend that effort to hide a likely serial killer. Shelly recommits to the hunt, convinced that perfect erasure is impossible and determined to find both Fay and whoever enabled the wipe.",
