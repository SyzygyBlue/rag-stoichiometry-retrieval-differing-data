    "full_scene_clean": "\"Well, I'll be dipped in shit,\" Quincy muttered, leaning on the doorframe, looking in at sleeping Chase on a cot in a small dorm room like hers—an upgrade from last night’s stone cell. At the infirmary, Chase fast-talked a nurse into letting him return to his bed and asked for someone to check on him since he couldn’t stay awake. A guard called—presumably Lenya—and a nurse actually came. The report: just bruises; sleep and food would fix it. Quincy moved to her own room in the same upper-level apartment: four private bedrooms (only two made up), a shared bath with flushing toilet and shower at the hall’s end. She sat on her soft cot, noting that only a thin, locked wooden door stood between them and a real chance at freedom. She didn’t know how Chase had pulled this off, but she wasn’t going to waste it. They were leaving Calum-Tam Holdfast—soon.",
    "dense_recap_250w": "Quincy surveys a sudden upgrade in living conditions within the Calum-Tam Holdfast: from stone cells to an upper-level apartment with four private rooms (two prepared) and a shared bathroom. Chase sleeps peacefully on a cot after persuading an infirmary nurse to release him back to his bed; a guard, likely after contacting Lenya, ensured a nurse checked on him. The exam confirms he is only bruised, needing rest and food. Quincy processes the whiplash from slave labor and hose-downs the day before to a nurse visit and soft cots now, her stomach churning at the incongruity. She returns to her own small room, cataloging the space and fixating on the single barrier to freedom: a thin, locked wooden door separating the apartment from the holdfast beyond. While she cannot explain how Chase engineered the change, she resolves to capitalize on it. The scene establishes their improved quarters, Chase’s non-critical condition, and Quincy’s intent to escape soon. It also underscores the holdfast’s contradictory veneer of care and continuing captivity—medical attention and private rooms paired with a locked exit—sharpening Quincy’s determination to turn the situation into an opportunity.",
