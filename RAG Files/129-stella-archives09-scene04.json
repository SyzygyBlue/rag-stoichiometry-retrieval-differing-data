    "full_scene_clean": "Shelly returned with fresh caf and reopened the message from her estranged mother, anger rising. After venting aloud, she typed: “Randy’s data trail went cold. All known identifiers for Fay were wiped from StellaNet a few years ago. I haven’t found anything new. It’s like she never existed.” She sent it, then a reply arrived within seconds: Michelle wrote that her team had grabbed everything about Fay when Shelly first mentioned her, kept it offline, noticed no progress, and asked if Shelly wanted access. Stunned by the implication of a connected ‘we,’ Shelly asked for access (“Yes”). Michelle responded with strict terms: data exchange only, no personal questions, relationship unchanged, use the same node for further requests, and do not tell Lucas (Shelly’s father). Shelly accepted: “I’ll take it.” Shaking, she closed messages, ordered a shower, undressed, and waited—no reconciliation offered, but a map and a key to chase.",
    "dense_recap_250w": "Back at her table with caf, Shelly steels herself and answers Michelle’s off-network outreach. She reports that Randy’s trail is cold and that Fay’s identifiers were wiped from StellaNet years ago, leaving no new leads. Almost immediately, Michelle replies that ‘we’ (her team) mirrored everything when Fay was first mentioned and kept it offline; seeing no progress, they offer access. Shelly grapples with the implications—Michelle is alive, resourced, and has quietly monitored her work. When Shelly agrees, Michelle lays down strict rules: no personal questions, only data exchange, relationship unchanged, further requests must be left on the same node, and Shelly must not tell her father. Shelly accepts the terms despite the ache of renewed distance, prioritizing the investigation over reconciliation. She orders a shower and prepares to move forward with the promised data. The scene cements a transactional arrangement that could revive the stalled Fay/Randy inquiry while enforcing a firm emotional firewall and secrecy regarding Lucas.",
