    "full_scene_clean": "Quincy grunted, sweat stinging her eyes as she fought a stubborn suspension bolt. The wrench slipped, scraping her knuckles. Better this than crying. Her eyes were raw from last night. Rest was dangerous—too many shadows in the quiet: Robyn’s laugh, her breath, her soap. So she worked: uninstall, clean, inspect, reinstall. She had promised not to fight. A stupid promise, but all she had. She tightened a bolt until her hand shook. She wanted to hit something. Gavin’s smirk. Mama Valorie’s voice like rusted wire. She squeezed the wrench until her blistered palm throbbed and kept going. Outside, the market swelled—skerv runners hauling crates, eyes flicking toward her, then away. Another screw, another breath. She kept moving, only stopping when dusk stole the light. She washed at the rear spigot, scrubbing grease that wouldn’t come off, road dirt under nails, a rust-colored smear on her arm—oil, maybe blood. Sober, she faced the dark. Sleep came somewhere in the night. Dawn bled across red dirt. Quincy sat up, bones stiff, hands sore. Another day: unbolt, inspect, scrub, reinstall. Mid-morning, newcomers arrived—dust-caked, wide-eyed refugees. Not yet skerv-lean: remnants of holdfast clothes, laced shoes, a girl clutching a doll, mothers with infants, a hollow-eyed boy. Fewer men. When holocreds aren’t enough, some stay behind. Most don’t make it this far. She forced her mind back to work. Lucky: alive, tools, work. But Robyn would lay in someone else’s bed. Their love would go underground. She tightened another part and let anger thrum in her wrists. By evening, Mama Valorie’s words echoed: be grateful. Look at these people. You could be them. Quincy stared into the wash bucket’s murk; her reflection looked bruised and hollow. A broken laugh clawed up. “Fuck Mama Valorie,” she whispered. The part slipped into the parts wash and hit the bucket with a cold, heavy thud.",
    "dense_recap_250w": "Quincy spends a punishing workday in the Three Shovels caravan market area, using mechanical labor to blunt the pain of the previous night’s revelation that Robyn must marry Gavin at Mama Valorie’s direction. Vowing not to fight, she channels rage into maintenance: uninstalling, cleaning, inspecting, and reinstalling parts, fighting a seized suspension bolt until her knuckles bleed. She pointedly avoids puro, fearing she’ll do something reckless if she drinks. As the market bustles, skerv runners keep their distance while she works until dusk, washes at a rear spigot, and collapses into uneasy sleep. At dawn she resumes, only to be confronted mid-morning by a small group of refugees—recently dispossessed families still wearing remnants of holdfast clothing, including a girl clutching a doll and a hollow-eyed boy. The sight underscores Mama Valorie’s rhetoric about gratitude and survival, but Quincy bristles at being told to accept injustice; she has done everything asked and still must watch the woman she loves be promised to another. Her thoughts circle Gavin, Mama Valorie, and the line between gratitude and complicity. She keeps tightening bolts, using work as anesthesia, yet recognizes that their love has been forced into secrecy. By day’s end, staring into a dirty parts bucket at a bruised reflection, she rejects imposed gratitude with a bitter whisper—“Fuck Mama Valorie”—and drops the part into the wash, its heavy thud matching the weight in her chest.",
