    "full_scene_clean": "Flies buzz over carnage as Quincy and Demmy cross open ground toward a leaning barn. Quincy carries a rusted iron pipe and her toolbox; Andreu’s .45 stays holstered unless last resort. They pass bodies and tin huts. A shed door opens: an old ravager shuffles out with a datapad. Quincy freezes until Demmy signals; she swings the pipe, felling him, and Demmy finishes him with precise shiv strikes. Shaken, Quincy follows Demmy to a field of stripped vehicles. Outside is a junkyard, but inside the dim barn are two motorcycles and a two-seat buggy. Using a light-amplification loop, Quincy inspects: one bike needs time-consuming swingarm work; the other has a bullet-holed motor; the buggy has a disconnected steering linkage (easy) and an open phase-coil circuit (she can patch). She repairs the linkage, patches wiring, and searches for charging gear, finally finding a rigid 1m×1m solar panel. They lash it on with old tie-downs and hook it to the distribution node. Packs and toolbox secured, Quincy hands Demmy the .45, then drives the buggy out as Demmy coaches her to mimic ravager swagger. A jump-scare mannequin riddled with bullet holes briefly panics Quincy, then they roll away from the camp toward red dirt and blue sky.",
    "dense_recap_250w": "Quincy and Demmy risk a daylight crossing through a ravager camp’s aftermath to reach a leaning barn that might hide workable transport. Quincy, gripping a rusted pipe and her toolbox, freezes when a shed opens and an old ravager steps out focused on a datapad. Pushed past paralysis, she clubs him down; Demmy dispatches him efficiently with a shiv. At the vehicle yard, exterior hulks are hopelessly cannibalized, but inside the barn Quincy finds two motorcycles and a two-seat electric buggy. Using a monocular light-amplification loop, she triages options: one bike would require drilling out a swingarm bolt; the second’s motor is bullet-destroyed; the buggy needs a steering re-link and has an open circuit on a motor phase coil—repairable enough to move, though inefficient and slow until fully fixed. Power is the next constraint; Demmy doesn’t know the tech, but Quincy locates a rigid 1m×1m solar panel. They strap it to the roof with weathered tie-downs, connect it to the distribution node, and load the toolbox and packs. Quincy gives Demmy the .45 for overwatch, then drives the buggy out while they feign ravager bravado to blend. A bullet-riddled mannequin spooks them, but no sentries appear. They clear the camp perimeter and head the way the caravan likely traveled, speed-limited and battery-constrained yet finally mobile.",
