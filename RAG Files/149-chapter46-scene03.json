    "full_scene_clean": "Chase\nEach jolt sent agony through him. He bit back a scream, teeth grinding. The world was a blur, dust and shadows. One eye was blurry—he couldn't blink it away. All he could focus on was the throb in his arm, the stabs in his ribs, and keeping his mouth shut so he didn't scream.\nHe had wanted independence, freedom. He had been carving out a life, a chance to prove his worth.\nSeems like I got my wish.\nFox River, his home, was gone. Reduced to ashes. Everyone he knew, everyone he loved, was dead. His mother, his friends... all gone. And even though he knew it was true, he felt confused. It felt like a circuit breaker had popped. Like a tri-D horror vid, when the scary music starts, and then suddenly, everything goes quiet... and you knew the monsters were about to arrive.\nExcept these monsters were real.\nToo much. He squeezed his eyes shut.\nHow could it have been Jessop? Chase still didn't believe it. Jessop loved Fox River. He had helped raise half the children Chase's age. Seen them in church. Been to their grandparents' funerals, baptized babies, presided at marriages. How could he destroy it? There was no way.\nConfusion. Disbelief. He couldn't comprehend the scale of the tragedy—the senselessness. The pain masked the ache. His mother was gone. No home, no bed. McTanner... a gut punch.\nNausea. He fought back the urge to vomit. It was sinking in. He was alone. Alone, with no idea what to do. His whole future had become a wasteland.",
    "dense_recap_250w": "Wracked by pain with a broken arm, likely broken ribs, and a swollen eye, Chase endures each jolt as he is moved through dust and shadow. His thoughts spiral from a hard-won independence to the annihilation of Fox River and everyone he knew, including his mother. The shock feels like a tripped circuit breaker—an eerie quiet before real monsters—capturing his dissociation and rising nausea. He cannot reconcile rumors that Jessop, a beloved priest who baptized babies, presided at marriages, and shepherded families, could be responsible for the destruction; he rejects the idea as impossible even as the loss becomes undeniable. Memories of McTanner hit like a gut punch, underscoring how completely his support network has been stripped away. Overwhelmed by grief, disbelief, and physical agony, Chase recognizes that he is alone with no clear path forward and that his imagined future has become a wasteland. The scene is interior, intimate, and focused on trauma processing: a character once intent on proving himself now confronts total devastation and a crisis of faith in people he trusted.",
