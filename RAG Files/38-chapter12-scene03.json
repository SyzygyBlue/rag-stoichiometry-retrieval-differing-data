    "full_scene_clean": "Chase drives the Fox River TEG-2 toward Quincy's coordinates, reflecting on eight months under a provisional TRG apprenticeship imposed by his mother, Chancellor Margdelain. He recalls grueling training, her refusal to acknowledge him at pinning, and his resolve to prove himself. Approaching three smoke plumes and rolling hills, he assembles a .50 caliber sniper rifle, aware the terrain could negate his range and the TEG-2’s speed. Hearing distant machine-gun fire, he parks short of a crest, crawls forward, and sights into a valley where a dark-haired woman and an emaciated young man—manning truck-mounted gun nests—fight a swarm of roughly twenty ravager vehicles circling the Three Shovels caravan. From ~500 meters, he begins eliminating drivers and climbers, working through magazine after magazine as his barrel overheats. The defenders’ belts run low; the woman fights a jam while the young man alternates between shotgun and feed. Ravagers finally spot Chase; rounds stitch the grass around him. He keeps prioritizing threats on the trucks, then turns his rifle on a squad charging his hill, cutting them down as they weave closer. The defenders’ fire sputters; bodies pile beneath the platforms. With his eighth magazine nearly empty and five hundred meters still on target, he notes only one round left, spends it to drop a climber at the woman’s nest, and ducks to reload under incoming fire, muttering for McTanner to arrive while committing to stay until the caravan is safe or his ammo is gone.",
    "dense_recap_250w": "Racing a TEG-2 toward Quincy's coordinates, Chase frames the fight as a test of the autonomy he seized eight months after rejecting Chancellor Margdelain’s diplomatic track. Near three smoke plumes and rolling hills, he assembles a .50 caliber sniper rifle, weighing risks: hills could erase his range advantage and expose him to a mid-range swarm. He halts short of a crest, crawls to a concealed depression, and sees a ravager wolf-pack of ~20 vehicles circling the Three Shovels caravan. Two defenders—a dark-haired woman and an emaciated young man—operate truck-mounted gun nests, trading fire at close range. From ~500 m Chase begins methodically shooting drivers and attackers, burning through magazines as the rifle and ambient air heat up. The defenders’ belts dwindle; the woman fights a feed jam while the young man alternates shotgun and belt handling. A subset of ravagers peels off to flank his hill; once they spot him, rounds cut the grass around his position. Chase keeps prioritizing climbers threatening the platforms, then turns his rifle on the charging squad, dropping most as they weave closer. With his eighth magazine nearly done and the defenders near empty, he spends his last visible round to stop a climber cresting the woman’s nest and ducks to reload, pinned and calling McTanner on the wind, resolved to hold until relief arrives or he runs dry.",
