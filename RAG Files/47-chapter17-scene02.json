    "full_scene_clean": "She let out a long breath through her nose, slow and measured, like pressure bleeding from a sealed valve. The call with McTanner had drained her. Not because Chase was injured. Not even because he had disobeyed her. But because he'd done it now. During this vote. When every hour mattered. Any other week, she could have spun the situation: a dramatic injury, a mother's concern, a burst of sympathy from the chamber. But not today. Not when she was a single vote away from real change. No. This had to stay buried. \"He's fine,\" she muttered, brushing the thought aside. McTanner would've said something if he wasn't. She trusted his judgment — even when he pissed her off. She pulled an old photo from a shelf high on her desk. Stacks of rust-streaked shipping containers leaned in the frame — early Fox River. There were ropes and pulleys, scaffolding, construction teams. Fox River ingenuity at its finest. Noisy. Patchworked. Vulnerable. It's not that much different today, just better paint. Her eyes narrowed. The Three Shovels Trade Caravan had vanished. No bodies. No wreckage. Just gone. And that bothered her more than she wanted to admit. Because wildlanders didn't make people disappear like that. They left chaos. Carnage. Flame. Not silence. This was someone else. Someone with an agenda. It would've been more expedient if the caravan had been eliminated, she admitted silently. If they were dead, there'd be nothing to investigate. No stories. No witnesses. No one to blow apart her momentum. But if they weren't dead… The survivors are going to come back here. One of them was on an operating table this very moment. They're going to tell their story, and that is going to matter. She realized it didn't matter who had actually done this. Jessop would seize it like a preacher at a funeral. He'd twist it into fear, into fury. Then he'd blame the Metrofederacy. He'd call Stella a monster. Claim that their terror troops had come to kidnap women and children and silence wildlanders in the night. Feed the fire. And it would work. She clenched her jaw. Jessop knew exactly how to manipulate fear — but she knew how to weaponize vision. Fox River was not safe. Not anymore. Not without help. Stella was not the boogeyman. She was the firewall. If an entire caravan full of people could vanish without a trace, that wasn't some wildlander feud. That was purpose with access to power. Bigger pieces were moving, and if Fox River didn't align with that power, they would be crushed by it eventually. Why can't he see that? Why can't any of them? She wiped dust from the frame and returned the photo to its shelf. Then she straightened her blouse. If Jessop got ahead of this narrative, it was over. He'd make them cling harder to tradition. She had to shape the conversation now, before he did — she had to move quickly. The truth was irrelevant. But the story had to be hers. I've got to win this vote. Margdelain took a deep breath and stood from her chair. \"Come on,\" she said, glancing to the Master Scrivener. \"Let's get that vote posted.\"",
    "dense_recap_250w": "In her office on the day of the council vote, Chancellor Margdelain processes McTanner’s report about Chase’s injury and disobedience—not out of maternal worry, but because the timing threatens her razor-thin margin to open an inquiry on joining the Metrofederacy. She studies an old photo of early Fox River and turns to the urgent mystery: the Three Shovels Trade Caravan has vanished without bodies or wreckage. To her, that silence implies a powerful actor with purpose, not typical Wildlander violence. She anticipates Brother Jessop will seize the event to inflame fear and blame Stella, weaponizing the narrative against Metro alignment. Determined to preempt him, she concludes that truth is secondary to shaping the story; Fox River needs protection and alignment with greater power or it will be crushed. She resolves to bury distracting news about Chase, control the message, and immediately post the vote. Margdelain summons the Master Scrivener to move, intent on owning the narrative before Jessop can define it.",
