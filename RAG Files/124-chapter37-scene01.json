    "full_scene_clean": "Demmy slips from a vent into the church corridors, tracking Evelyn’s dot on his screen toward unmapped lower levels. He adjusts his robes and pendant to pass as a brother, concealing repurposed scissors up his sleeve. Moving with purpose, he carries a file as a prop, scavenges three metal letter openers as shivs, and searches a maintenance closet—no secret door. He studies a small chapel and the screened side panel. After a drink of water, he grabs a box of tools to support a cover story and ducks behind the screen into a service passage. At a door marked AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY, he enters and meets a robed guard on a stairwell. “Stuck drawer,” Demmy says, hefting the toolbox. After a tense beat, the guard lets him pass with a warning to stay out of where he doesn’t belong. Demmy descends, gripping the hidden scissors, intent on reaching Evelyn.",
    "dense_recap_250w": "Demmy infiltrates Fox River’s interior to reach an uncharted lower level where Evelyn’s location beacon points. He masks himself as a routine cleric: robes arranged, pendant visible, a file in hand for plausibility, and a hidden forearm-length scissor blade for defense. Along the way, he quietly arms up with three letter openers, checks a maintenance closet, and notes a chapel with a screened section that likely hides service access. To legitimize his presence, he returns for a toolbox and uses a plausible task—fixing a “stuck drawer.” The screen conceals a dim corridor leading to a door labeled AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY. Inside, a stairwell guard with a red badge challenges him. Demmy maintains his cover under pressure, and after a long second the guard relents, telling him to be quick and to stay out of restricted areas. Demmy descends toward the depths, balancing urgency to save Evelyn with discipline not to harm innocents, and readying for violence against the guilty when he reaches them.",
