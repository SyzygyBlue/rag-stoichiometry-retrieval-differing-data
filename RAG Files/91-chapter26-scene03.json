    "full_scene_clean": "Two weeks into monastery life, Demmy sits in the Fox River Library stalled on an archaic religious tome, feeling guilt and restlessness as people still suffer in the wildlands. Evelyn has been meeting him daily—discussing assigned texts, walking in the garden, and asking about his past. Today she finishes chores early and joins him. They debate study and prayer versus urgent action: Demmy calls sitting and reading a kind of hiding; Evelyn argues for patience, faith, and wisdom before action, yet agrees prayer alone is not enough. She shows a worn paperback, The Dark Heart of Eldoria, admits she loves stories, and confesses she was assigned to help him—but now feels called to break the “normal, boring” rules to truly help. She proposes they walk to the gardens and later find a quiet place at night where Demmy can tell her everything. Demmy hesitates—suspecting he’s being kept safely tucked away—but is moved by Evelyn’s sincerity. They leave the library together, Demmy praying not for himself but for her safety.",
    "dense_recap_250w": "Demmy struggles to engage with a dense, metaphor-heavy religious text while survivor’s guilt gnaws at him: people are dying in the wildlands as he studies in safety. Over the prior two weeks, Evelyn has become his daily companion—curious about his past, gently supportive, and increasingly focused on him more than the books. When she arrives, they candidly debate whether study and prayer are sufficient. Demmy fears reading is “hiding,” while Evelyn insists learning to ask God the right questions matters, but concedes that faith must pair with action. A revealing beat follows: a worn paperback, The Dark Heart of Eldoria, shows Evelyn’s appetite for heroic narratives. She then discloses that she was officially assigned to help Demmy because she follows rules—yet now feels called not to follow the usual script. Evelyn proposes a walk to the gardens and later a clandestine, quiet place to talk that night so Demmy can share everything. Demmy recognizes signs he’s being kept in the monastery to study and remain out of public view, but Evelyn’s warmth and seriousness shift his mood. He agrees to go with her, wrestling with trust and danger, and whispers a prayer that God keep Evelyn safe.",
