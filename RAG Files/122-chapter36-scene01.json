    "full_scene_clean": "Chase was exhausted, glad no one wanted him in bed. He sat against a concrete column, watching Quincy and Lesha at the autopacker. Quincy wore boxy AR glasses; Lesha fetched tools for her. Lenya had told Chase she would be at Holdfast meetings and see him later.\n\"Hey, Sparkles,\" Quincy said through the glasses, urging him to try them. She was trying to access the file server using—\n\"SCALPEL scripts,\" Lesha supplied. Quincy read the acronym off the HUD: \"Source Concealing Adaptive Logic Polymorphic Entry/Exploit Link,\" then asked what it meant.\nLesha laughed: lockpicks for computer locks. She had only one SCALPEL that would work on the Holdfast systems. She warned Miss Bossypants would be back soon to collect her \"fucktoy.\"\nChase asked if they could be detected. Lesha said detection would require AEGIS, the SCALPEL counterpart; she doubted Calum-Tam had it, and even if it triggered, locals wouldn’t know what it meant.\nQuincy hammered an antique keyboard tethered to the glasses, eyes tracking invisible panes. She froze, then grinned wide and whooped. \"I'm in! I see lots of files!\" Lesha grinned too, her amusement edged with sadness as Quincy dove into the Holdfast’s digital labyrinth.",
    "dense_recap_250w": "In the warehouse autopacker bay, an exhausted Chase rests while Quincy and Lesha work. Quincy uses a set of AR glasses—previously set up by Lesha—to attempt access to the Holdfast’s file server. When Quincy asks about tooling, Lesha names and defines SCALPEL scripts (“Source Concealing Adaptive Logic Polymorphic Entry/Exploit Link”), describing them as software lockpicks. Chase worries about detection; Lesha explains that AEGIS is the defensive counterpart to SCALPEL and doubts the Calum-Tam Holdfast has it or the expertise to interpret alerts. Quincy drives the intrusion via an antique keyboard cabled to the glasses, scanning multiple HUD panes only she can see. After tense moments, she breaks through, exclaiming that she is in and can see many files. Lesha is openly pleased yet visibly bittersweet as she watches Quincy succeed. Meanwhile, Lenya is absent, attending Holdfast meetings, which creates a window for the intrusion. The scene establishes operational roles, names key offensive/defensive cyber tools, and culminates in Quincy gaining access to potentially incriminating or leverage-worthy data on the Holdfast servers.",
