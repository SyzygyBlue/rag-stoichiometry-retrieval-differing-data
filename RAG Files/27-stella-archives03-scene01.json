    "full_scene_clean": "Michelle has resisted integrating with Stella for nine months, even as Lucas and their children, Randy and Shelly, thrive. After an affecting visit to a geriatric home, the family eats together; Lucas announces he is close to another promotion. When the kids ask about Michelle’s SAIR, she reluctantly accepts AR sharing so they can see through her eyes. Shelly drives the SAIR interface, bookmarking a dashboard and presenting matched career paths. With the kids’ coaching, Michelle selects a starting specification—grief counselor—while they explain Stella’s skill overlap, DIFF reports, mentoring, and work requirements (no jobs until 18; adults must maintain time across chosen specs to keep compensation). Michelle agrees to read foundational theory (five stages of grief) and attempt a test soon. The family is warm and supportive, but Michelle remains uneasy, feeling shepherded by an inflexible system even as she resolves to try for their sake.",
    "dense_recap_250w": "Michelle, alienated by Stella’s structured life and optimization culture, has avoided engaging with her SAIR for months despite her family’s success. Randy (13) speeds through advanced math/physics and Shelly (10) excels at music and 3DO content; Lucas studies his SAIR to plan orthogonal moves and is near another promotion. Over Chinese takeout, the kids ask Michelle about her SAIR. She consents to AR eye-sharing so they can guide her. Shelly opens the SAIR dashboard, bookmarks it, and shows occupation matches, emphasizing transferable skills across counseling/psychology tracks. Randy explains DIFF reports to identify deltas, Stella’s auto-mentoring when tests are failed, and how specifications and compensation work. The children confirm they are not required to work until age 18; adults must allocate time to maintain chosen specs or risk losing them. Michelle selects ‘grief counselor’ as a starting specification and promises to study the five stages of grief and test soon. While the session lowers Michelle’s confusion and highlights a feasible path (social work/counseling), she privately fears she will be faking compliance and will never fully fit a system that feels formulaic and shepherding. The scene ends with familial closeness and Michelle’s tentative commitment, undercut by enduring distrust of Stella.",
