    "full_scene_clean": "The slap cracked through the morning air. Quincy stumbled, hand to her cheek, as onlookers peeked from tents and trailers. Robyn’s blazing eyes pinned her; then Robyn kissed her—hard, angry, desperate—before delivering a second slap. Robyn warned: “Don’t you ever do that again. Not to me. Not to anyone.” Quincy, ashamed, asked Robyn to say what she felt. Through tears, Robyn named sadness, betrayal, anger—and worst, feeling cheap and like she didn’t matter—then also admitted feeling loved, adored, sacrificed for, and important. She told Quincy the act was reckless and that Quincy had no right to risk their happiness and future. Quincy promised never again. Robyn’s anger eased; she squeezed Quincy’s hand, said she didn’t know how she’d get along without her. They shared a trembling kiss—apology and promise—then Robyn walked away lighter. Quincy stood trembling, exhausted but grateful.",
    "dense_recap_250w": "At dawn in the Three Shovels encampment, Robyn publicly confronts Quincy over the previous night’s reckless dice wager that gambled their relationship. In full view of curious onlookers, Robyn slaps Quincy, kisses her, then slaps her again, and delivers a clear boundary: never do that again to her or anyone. Invited by Quincy to voice the harm, Robyn lays out complex emotions—sadness, betrayal, anger—but most painfully that the wager made her feel cheap and unimportant. She also acknowledges feeling loved and sacrificed for, revealing the contradictory impact of Quincy's act. Robyn frames the issue as consent and agency: Quincy didn’t have the right to risk their shared future without her. Quincy, shaken and remorseful, promises never to repeat it and accepts the rebuke. The confrontation softens into a fragile reconciliation: hand squeeze, shared kiss, and Robyn departing steadier, while Quincy remains trembling with relief and exhaustion. The scene resolves the immediate emotional fallout of the wager, establishes new boundaries in their relationship, and signals that their bond continues—conditional on Quincy’s restraint and respect.",
