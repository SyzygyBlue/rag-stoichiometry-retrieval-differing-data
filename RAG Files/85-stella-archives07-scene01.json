    "full_scene_clean": "The building was unmarked—only a thin vertical tag glowing in the synthetic brick near the entrance: Core Medical Archive 17B. Inside, sterilized, faintly metallic air and soft, cool blue lighting. Floors silent. No attendants—just Shelly and Stella. A glowing guide line appeared on the floor: Follow the guide. Next checkpoint: 44 meters. Doors hissed open in sequence, perfectly timed to her steps. Shelly adjusted the sleeves of her cream-colored cardigan on her PID avatar as her authorization pinged: Welcome, Shelly. Proceed to Sector 4. Your authorization has been accepted. At the fourth junction a door slid open: Enter. Specimen 291874237: Active Preservation Status. Temperature: -4°C. Tissue Integrity: Grade B. In a small, windowless vault a capsule rose on an elevated tray, pale blue light washing over the body within. Randy. The session HUD appeared: Cadaver Ready. Observation Session: Initialized. Forensic toolkit: Standing by. Biometrics: Available. PID Logs: Limited Access — Level III (Redacted: Personal Data Sealed). Alone with Stella’s system prompts, Shelly stepped forward, ready.",
    "dense_recap_250w": "Shelly (Citizen ID 291874231) enters an unmarked facility labeled only as Core Medical Archive 17B. Her PID confirms authorization, and the archive’s guidance system—voiced by or associated with an AI named Stella—renders a glowing floor line that escorts her through a series of automatically timing doors. The environment is sterile, silent, and highly automated, emphasizing precision and anonymity. Shelly maintains a composed exterior, even adjusting her avatar’s cardigan via her PID as she proceeds without human staff. At Sector 4, a chamber announces Specimen 291874237 with parameters: Active Preservation Status, −4°C, Tissue Integrity Grade B. Inside a compact, windowless vault, a preservation capsule rises on command, revealing a pale, blue-tinged body identified by Shelly as Randy. System overlays initialize: an Observation Session with a forensic toolkit, biometrics access, and PID logs limited by Level III redactions (personal data sealed). The scene ends with Shelly alone, poised to begin whatever examination or farewell she intends, framed by the contrast between intimate loss and a frictionless, clinical interface to death.",
