    "full_scene_clean": "Two months after Randy’s death notice, Michelle cycles between rage and collapse. In a home meditation pod—a sealed chair with wind-chime audio and massage—she tries a self-guided grief protocol via her PID but aborts it, cursing Stella for letting her son die and withholding answers. A tachycardia indicator flashes as she fights the urge to smash the pod. Shelly, monitoring outside, insists Michelle either complete the protocol or request a real counselor. After tense back-and-forth, Michelle promises to request counseling if Shelly walks away now. When Shelly leaves, Michelle wraps her arms around herself and uses her PID menus to submit the counseling request, despite wanting oblivion instead.",
    "dense_recap_250w": "Two months after receiving the clinical Stella notice of her son Randy’s death, Michelle is unraveling. In a home meditation pod with a massage chair and wind-chime soundtrack, she attempts the Self-Guided Grief Protocol available to licensed grief counselors but immediately rejects it, snarling at Stella for failing to protect her son and for providing no explanation. Her rage spikes—she nearly strikes the pod—while a tachycardia alert pulses in her HUD. Shelly, standing outside and tracking the session, pleads with her to continue or to contact a human counselor. Michelle refuses the program, saying only a counselor request will make Shelly stop hounding her. Through gritted teeth, she bargains: if Shelly gives her space and walks away, she’ll submit the request. After a strained pause, Shelly agrees and asks for the confirmation receipt. Alone in the pod, arms wrapped around herself, Michelle navigates her PID menus and places the order for counseling, noting she’d rather burn everything down. The scene centers Michelle’s grief hardened into powerless fury, the family’s fraying dynamics, and the omnipresent Stella systems that track and nudge behavior while withholding the sealed truth of Randy’s death.",
