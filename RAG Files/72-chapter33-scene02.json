    "full_scene_clean": "Quincy drives the Fox River TEG-4 four-seater along the dusty gravel road toward Broken Bow while Chase sits silent beside her. The cab is cool and scentless, the active suspension smoothing the ride; outside, sun glare and dust. Chase worries about how to mention the implantable holocred chip his mother gave him. When he sighs, Quincy cuts a glare and calls him Sparkles. He offers a canteen; she drinks, then says she is better with machines than people and needs time. She states clearly that she likes girls and has a girlfriend, Robyn, whom she is trying to save. Chase replies, \"Then let's go get her back.\" As they pass bushes, Quincy spots a man by the roadside holding a small box with a thick wire trailing away. She yanks the wheel, shouting, and the TEG-4 begins to arc as the suspension whines. An instant later, the world erupts in an explosion.",
    "dense_recap_250w": "In a climate-controlled TEG-4 cart, Quincy drives toward Broken Bow with Chase after an hour of tense silence. Chase frets about disclosing an implantable holocred chip from his mother, Margdelain, while trying not to violate Quincy’s ‘no lies’ ground rule. When he sighs, Quincy confronts him; he deflects with water and patience. She explains she’s slow to trust, prefers machines to people, and explicitly states she’s gay and focused on rescuing her girlfriend, Robyn. Chase seizes on the mission—“let’s go get her back”—but the fragile rapport is cut short when Quincy notices a man at the roadside holding a small box with a heavy wire leading away, a clear sign of a trigger device. She yanks the wheel to evade as the TEG-4’s active suspension whines into a curve. A blast detonates, ending the scene mid-ambush. The passage advances their uneasy partnership (she drives; he follows her lead), clarifies stakes (find Robyn), and introduces an external threat bent on stopping or killing them. It also underscores class/tech contrasts: outside heat, dust, and danger versus Fox River’s polished machinery and resources inside the vehicle. The unresolved explosion sets immediate peril and raises questions about who laid the trap and whether the attackers are linked to Fox River politics, road bandits, or other enemies.",
