    "full_scene_clean": "Demmy adopts the upright, casual posture of clergy as he descends to an unmapped lower level to find Evelyn. He stages a wooden toolbox on the steps, threads three Order-marked letter openers through his robe hem for quick draw, and removes his sandals to stay silent. At the stairwell desk a man nods to music on his communicator; Demmy lures him close, covers his mouth, extracts the direction to the girl, then drives the repurposed scissors into the base of the skull. He takes the red plastic badge and the communicator labeled ANTHONY, props the body in the chair, and walks on. In a hallway with six offices, he enters the first, convinces the bearded occupant to rise, then quietly kills him the same way, pocketing a yellow card and noting the wall certificate: DANIEL. He finds the next office empty, then continues, dispatching two more workers with swift, silent strikes, hiding bodies under desks. At the last door, a woman named PAM challenges him about his bare feet and not being recognized. He vaults the desk and cuts her jugular; blood pools and soils his robe. He rips cloth to blot but the smell is heavy. To avoid attention, he strips a previous victim and dons the clean robe, drops his soiled one on the corpse, and proceeds toward the corridor’s end, time pressing.",
    "dense_recap_250w": "Moving as a mimic of complacent clergy, Demmy enters a restricted lower level to rescue Evelyn and punish those collaborating with ravagers. He prepares for quiet kills: three Order-emblem letter openers threaded through his robe for left-hand draws, scissors hidden in-sleeve, sandals removed for silence. At the stairwell checkpoint, he wordlessly coerces a desk guard listening to music to point out where the girl was taken, then kills him with a precise base-of-skull thrust and takes the man’s red badge and communicator labeled ANTHONY. In the adjacent office corridor, Demmy repeats his pattern: casual entry, minimal dialogue, mouth covered, scissor strike up through the cervical gap; he pockets a yellow card from the bearded worker DANIEL and hides bodies under desks. Two more offices are cleared the same way without raising an alarm. The final office occupant, PAM, notices his bare feet and questions him; Demmy vaults the desk and slashes her jugular—messier than his preferred method—so he swaps robes with an earlier victim to remove blood evidence and smell before continuing down the hall. The sequence shows Demmy’s shift into a scripture-justified avenger: efficient, adaptive, and racing the clock, acquiring access credentials (red badge, yellow card) while advancing deeper toward Evelyn’s presumed location.",
