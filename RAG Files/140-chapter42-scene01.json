    "full_scene_clean": "Quincy sits numbly on the filthy cell floor, the air thick with mildew, rotten food, and unwashed bodies. Chase, in the adjacent cell, has been savagely beaten by Carl; his forearm is broken with bone protruding, and he struggles to breathe from likely cracked ribs. Hearing silence after Carl’s departure, Quincy begins removing loose bricks between the cells, wrapping them in straw to muffle the blows. Chase begs her to stop for her safety; she refuses, saying if Lenya wants to kill them, she’ll have to do it while they’re together. Quincy assesses his injuries, decides the bone must be set and patched to avoid infection, and keeps working until the gap is wide enough to attempt a squeeze. Exhausted, Chase thanks her and drifts to sleep; Quincy stands guard in the darkness, clutching bricks and listening to his breathing, ready to fight if Carl returns.",
    "dense_recap_250w": "In a grim cell block at the Calum-Tam Holdfast, Quincy reels from the aftermath of Carl’s prolonged assault on Chase. The stench of hay and rot underscores the trauma: Quincy remembers the arm-breaking pop and scream as Carl continued the beating until Chase’s voice dwindled to nothing. When Carl returns to unlock Chase’s door and then vanishes, Quincy acts. She pulls a loose brick between their cells, muffling each strike with straw despite the risk of alerting guards. Through the widening gap she sees the extent of the damage: Chase’s forearm is a compound fracture with a shard of bone protruding; he can’t breathe deeply and likely has broken ribs. He pleads for her to stop so she won’t be next, but Quincy refuses, vowing not to leave his side again—if Lenya intends to kill them, she’ll have to do it while they’re together. Quincy triages as best she can, noting no obvious internal bleeding but warning that without setting and sealing the wound, infection is inevitable in such filth. Their failed earlier plan is acknowledged but not blamed; she even jokes darkly about a sundress, trying to buoy him. Chase thanks her and falls into an uneasy sleep. Quincy remains alert for hours, bricks in hand as improvised weapons, listening for his breathing and preparing to fight Carl if he returns.",
