    "full_scene_clean": "Fay still thought about Randy sometimes—along with other men she had reduced to limp husks by manipulating their neurochemistry until motivation collapsed. She relished total control, perfecting a long, incremental process that ended in living zombies. Randy was her favorite and the only one who realized what she was doing and resisted; she broke him anyway to learn how and why he could fight back. Fay describes her method: remote presence via a holo wrapped around a silicone doll inside pleasure pods; layered innocuous scripts run on the targets’ optical processors to evade Stella’s malware monitors and quietly seize neuroject control; careful titration of serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine, and adrenal response to engineer dependence and ruin. The men’s deaths appeared as unremarkable “failure to thrive,” fueling her research (e.g., corpus callosum mapping) and academic rise. A centrifuge alarm cuts her reverie in her Tahua Outpost Special Projects lab. As she works slides and samples, Li Mei, the emotionless head of Balance Party Special Projects, arrives and orders: “Prep Skree for fieldwork.” Timeline: 30–45 days. Fay, a senior brain/cybernetics scientist, shuts down equipment to begin, reflecting that Skree is her masterpiece and that many lesser variants are already seeded across the Metrofederacy in cryptography and advanced mathematics labs. She hurries out, uneasy in the concrete corridors where worse monsters than her lurk.",
    "dense_recap_250w": "In a chilling internal monologue, Fay recounts how she weaponized Metrofederacy implants to enslave and ultimately destroy men, leaving them as apathetic, emaciated corpses labeled “failure to thrive.” She never appeared physically with victims, instead projecting a localized holo over a remote silicone doll in pleasure pods. By stacking hundreds of innocuous scripts on their optical processors to evade Stella’s malware monitors, she covertly took control of their neurojects and administered tailored neurotransmitter cocktails. She fine-tuned serotonin/dopamine/norepinephrine dynamics to escalate dependence over months, collecting data that propelled her PhD and postdoc work (including corpus callosum research). Randy was unique—he perceived the manipulation and resisted—so she “broke” him to understand his resilience. A lab centrifuge beeps in Tahua Outpost, where Fay serves as a senior scientist in Balance Party Special Projects. Li Mei, the cold, elderly program head, arrives and tersely orders Fay to prep “Skree” for field deployment within 30–45 days. Fay complies, pleased to focus on her masterpiece; Tahua has produced many like Skree—hybrid human-machine problem solvers embedded across Metrofederacy institutions—but none equal to her design. As she secures her slides and shuts down equipment, she moves through ominous concrete corridors, noting that, here, she is not the scariest presence. The scene confirms Fay’s authorship of methods that could explain falsified logs and engineered deaths, reveals Balance Party command structure, and foreshadows Skree’s coming mission.",
