    "full_scene_clean": "A week later, Shelly woke a minute before her alarm in pre-dawn gray. The apartment was hollow-quiet, only the HVAC’s soft mechanical hum. Her PID blinked yellow: 1 New Message – Non-StellaNet Origin. She expected an automated delay from a request, but the sender line hit hard: From: mmichellek_2351090.chey.ppn, Subject: The Case, Timestamp: 04:12. She sat up, breath catching, and ordered a kitchen from the multifunc. With a steaming caf at her tiny table, the unopened message hovered in her vision. She hadn’t seen that address in years; Michelle had never replied to the dozen updates Shelly had sent. She opened it. The body read: “I haven’t heard anything new from you in a long time. How is the investigation going?” No greeting. No apology. Just that. Shelly read it again, feeling only the slow throb of awareness that the dead had texted. She ordered a toilet from the multifunc, closed the message, and went to pee.",
    "dense_recap_250w": "Pre-dawn in her silent apartment, Shelly receives a yellow-blink PID notification marked “Non-StellaNet Origin.” Expecting routine bureaucracy, she instead sees an address she hasn’t encountered in years: her estranged mother, Michelle (mmichellek_2351090.chey.ppn), subject “The Case,” timestamped 04:12. Shelly orders caf via the multifunc and sits at her small table, the message hovering in view. She recalls sending a handful of one-way updates over the years and never receiving a reply. She opens the note and finds a single, impersonal line: “I haven’t heard anything new from you in a long time. How is the investigation going?” There is no greeting, apology, or personal sentiment. The brevity lands with the eerie weight of contact from someone emotionally dead to her. Shelly processes without overt reaction—no rage or relief—just a heightened pulse and a practical decision: close the message and summon a toilet. The scene foregrounds estrangement, routine numbness, and the intrusion of a non-Stella channel into Shelly’s controlled professional life.",
