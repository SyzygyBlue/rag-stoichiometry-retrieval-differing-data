    "full_scene_clean": "“You getting this?” Alejandro asked, staring at the ruined expanse of Fox River through the quadrafan’s window. Werner, directing a mesh of drones, grimly confirmed: six-axis tri-D, sound, even simulated stench. Maggots writhed over stagnant water; clouds of flies fouled rotors; looters slogged through hip-deep carnage. Werner fought nausea while his fly-eye drones hovered and docked on command. Alejandro ordered ginger ale, shut his SAIR coursework, and steadied him. The producer had capped their StellaNet broadcast to ninety seconds—insulting against the scale of death. Alejandro proposed they do more than report: shift their careers to investigative reporting and forensic photography, register a case, and pursue whoever was powerful enough to erase a city. Werner agreed: no one cares about wildlanders; they had an obligation. They planned to land upwind on a rise for the stand-up, then grid-sweep with forensic drones for crime-scene coverage, hire a fixer and a local merc team to secure evidence, and—per Stella’s recommendation—pick up a forensic investigator before heading to Broken Bow Free City. Ransom Canyon was closer but too dangerous; ravagers don’t talk. As Werner docked drones and shuttered his silver oculars, Alejandro warmed up for the live hit, resentment simmering at the ninety-second slot. The quadrafan angled toward the ridge. “Thirty seconds…”",
    "dense_recap_250w": "From a quadrafan over Fox River’s smoking ruins, reporter Alejandro and cameraman-sensor Werner capture a multi-drone, six-axis tri-D reconstruction of the mass-casualty site. The imagery and simulated smell overwhelm Werner as fly-eye drones transmit maggots, flies, broken pipes, water, and looters scavenging through bodies and debris. Their StellaNet producer limits them to a 90-second segment, but Alejandro argues they must go beyond broadcast: formally pivot career tracks to investigative reporting (Alejandro) and forensic photography (Werner), register the incident as an investigation, and pursue those responsible if the destruction was deliberate. Werner agrees, citing an obligation to wildlanders. They outline immediate steps: land upwind on a ridge for the stand-up; deploy a forensic drone grid for documentation focused on evidentiary coverage; secure a discretionary fund to hire a local merc team to buy and protect relevant items before looters strip the site; and, per Stella’s guidance, pick up a forensic investigator before traveling to Broken Bow Free City to develop leads (avoiding nearer Ransom Canyon due to ravager danger). As Werner docks drones and reconfigures his ocular sensors for the live hit, Alejandro rehearses, furious at condensing a mass atrocity into seconds. The scene ends with the broadcast countdown and a clear commitment to a deeper inquiry.",
