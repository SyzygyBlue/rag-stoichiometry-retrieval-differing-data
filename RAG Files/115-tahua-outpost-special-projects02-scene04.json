    "full_scene_clean": "Fay watched Jejune’s face as they exited Skree’s stream. Jejune stayed quiet, then blinked and looked at Fay. “What was that?”\n“Multidimensional, holographic encryption,” Fay said. “Similar to the holographic non-linear array algorithm that secures the holocred network. We watched Skree crack it.”\n“I was swimming in a sea of data,” Jejune said, running her fingers through her hair. “I don’t know how anyone could make sense of that, but it was incredible.”\n“And it only took her thirty-six seconds,” Fay said.\n“It was beautiful,” Jejune said. “I could watch that forever.”\nFay smiled. The malware scripts had finished deploying long ago. “I’m pretty sure you’re right.”\nTick-tock, little fish.",
    "dense_recap_250w": "After leaving Skree’s inner stream, Fay observes Jejune’s stunned reaction. When Jejune asks what she just experienced, Fay identifies it as a multidimensional, holographic encryption, akin to the holographic non-linear array used to secure the holocred network. The two had just witnessed Skree decrypt it from within her perspective. Jejune describes the experience as immersion in a vast sea of data and admits she could not make sense of it, though she found it thrilling. Fay quantifies Skree’s feat: thirty-six seconds from start to finish. Jejune calls it beautiful and says she could watch it for the rest of her life, signaling how captivating Skree’s cognitive performance is to an outside observer. Internally, Fay confirms to herself that her malware packages—previously delivered during the tri-D session—have fully deployed. With the technical demonstration complete and Jejune entranced by what she saw, Fay’s predatory confidence surfaces again in a silent refrain: “Tick-tock, little fish.” The scene cements two facts for retrieval: the nature of the encryption class Skree can break and the precise speed of her decryption, alongside the status of Fay’s covert compromise of Jejune.",
