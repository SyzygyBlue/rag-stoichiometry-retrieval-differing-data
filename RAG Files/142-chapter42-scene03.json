    "full_scene_clean": "Pain saturates Chase as Quincy urges him up—Demmy has arrived. In total darkness he’s hauled to his feet; agony spikes through his left arm and a racking cough wrings more pain from his chest. Demmy warns of a dead body ahead; Chase’s feet bump over it as Quincy and Demmy drag him toward wooden steps linking the holding pens above to the cells below. Every step jolts his dangling arm. Disoriented, nauseated, and exhausted, Chase wants to sleep, but they keep him moving. They push through doors and emerge into the dimly lit streets of the holdfast.",
    "dense_recap_250w": "From Chase’s pain-blurred perspective, Quincy rouses him with urgent news: Demmy is here. The cell block is in blackout, and Chase can barely see; one eye is blurry and both are nearly swollen shut. As Quincy and Demmy lift him under the arms, a spike of agony tears through his left arm and a violent cough compounds his pain. Demmy hisses a warning about a corpse up ahead—“don’t trip”—and the trio shuffle forward, Chase’s feet knocking against the body before they reach a flight of wooden stairs. The steps connect the upper holding pens to the lower cells; each upward movement sends fresh shockwaves through Chase’s injuries. Disoriented and nauseated, he fades in and out, whispers that it hurts, and nearly begs for oblivion, but Quincy and Demmy keep him moving. They shoulder him through interior doors and out into the dimly lit streets of the Calum-Tam Holdfast, transitioning the rescue from the subterranean confinement to the surface, where the escape will continue. The scene focuses on endurance, urgency, and teamwork under dire physical strain, with environmental hazards (darkness, obstacles, stairs) and the constant risk of collapse from Chase’s condition.",
