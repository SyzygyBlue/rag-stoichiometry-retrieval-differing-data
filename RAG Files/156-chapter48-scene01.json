    "full_scene_clean": "Shelly’s PID was a mess of folders, tags, color tabs and a red folder marked “FAY?”. Running on caf and little sleep, she scraped her mother’s massive datastore with 37 scripts and a dirty AI patterning daemon. Trails pointed to a subcontractor farm in Austria and traffic across the Macrobus spine into dead nodes. Four new “FAY?” hits landed. A message from her father, Lucas, asked for lunch. She showered and met him at a small French bistro. They talked briefly about her MD cert progress; he urged her to finish it, then asked where the data came from. Shelly admitted Michelle had asked her not to tell him. Lucas said the archive wasn’t Michelle’s style—it was theatrical, a puzzle meant to be noticed, likely bait. Shelly realized the same: Fay. Lucas shared findings: a peculiar encrypted stream using CF-67, with endpoints in a near-abandoned Bolivian town by a salt flat and in Broken Bow Free City (Oklahoma). Once a day at 06:17, a numeric header flag appeared; converted digit-for-digit, it matched Randy’s citizen ID—Randy’s birthday is 6/17. They concluded the tag was intentional and that they were the mouse in a cat-and-mouse game. They agreed: finish Shelly’s Forensic Investigator IV path, gather rock-solid evidence, surface it where Stella can see, and, if possible, create bounties. They parted after a brief hug, both uneasy but committed.",
    "dense_recap_250w": "Shelly, exhausted but driven, combs through a colossal datastore she attributes to her mother Michelle, using 37 scraper scripts and a lightweight AI to stitch signals from logs, packet traces, heatmaps, StellaNet pings, and dead-node recoveries. A red folder labeled “FAY?” accrues hits. Her father Lucas unexpectedly invites her to a nearby French bistro. After urging her to complete an MD cert on the way to Forensic Investigator IV, he challenges the dataset’s provenance: the archive’s recursive metadata and theatrical misdirection do not fit Michelle’s style and look like bait crafted by a puzzle-maker. Shelly concedes the likely author is Fay. Lucas then reveals a high-stakes discovery: he has been monitoring a CF-67 (top-tier Metrofederacy) encrypted stream with endpoints in a tiny, near-abandoned Bolivian town by a salt flat and in Broken Bow Free City (South-Central Oklahoma). The packets are huge and bi-directional; once per day at precisely 06:17 a special numeric flag appears, which converts to Randy’s citizen ID—also Randy’s birthday (6/17). Father and daughter infer the tag is deliberate provocation and that they are targets in a cat-and-mouse game. They resolve to proceed carefully but publicly: Shelly will finish FI-IV certification, compile incontrovertible evidence from the datastore, and use Stella visibility and bounty powers to pursue non-Metrofederacy actors. They part with shared dread and determination.",
