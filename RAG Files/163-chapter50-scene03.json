    "full_scene_clean": "Quincy and Lesha manhandle the unconscious, bandaged Chase up a stairwell and into a shabby room. They drop him on the bed; Lesha collapses on the couch, already sweating and shaking with Sykotiq withdrawal. Demmy sits against the far wall, knees up, eyes open but hollow, not speaking since Fox River. Quincy holds their last half-vial of Sykotiq, hesitating as Lesha tries to be stoic and tells Quincy to give it to her and go chase leads on a cryptowitch. The room is stale and dim, a flickering holoscreen spitting ads. Quincy is torn: leave to search for her missing family or stay and care for her wrecked crew. They share cigarettes. Lesha gently but firmly reframes the choice: either go and cut clean, or stay and own it fully—because loyalty isn’t endless. They talk about Chase’s character and past sacrifice for Quincy, how he took beatings to protect her at Calum-Tam and never backed down. Lesha argues that not all brothers are blood and suggests Quincy survived because of him. Quincy admits she “never wanted to see it.” Finally, Quincy decides. She presses the vial into Lesha’s palm, vowing to find more Sykotiq, and accepts responsibility for “her people.” Lesha doses with a click and ragged exhale; the tension eases. Quincy looks at Chase’s new blue-black prosthetic arm, the wrap over his eyes, and Demmy’s empty stare. No more excuses—she commits to stay and lead, for better or worse.",
    "dense_recap_250w": "Exhausted from hauling an unconscious, freshly augmented Chase to a dingy room, Quincy and a shaking, withdrawing Lesha confront a brutal resource triage: a half-vial of Sykotiq remains, Demmy is catatonic, and Chase lies bandaged with a new prosthetic arm and wrapped eyes awaiting calibration. Quincy, desperate to hunt a cryptowitch and her lost family, weighs leaving against the immediate needs of her crew. Lesha urges clarity: either go and don’t look back, or stay and own the consequences because loyalty has limits. Over cigarettes, they reckon with Chase’s history—he took beatings for Quincy at Calum-Tam and never stopped protecting her. Lesha frames him as the rare ally who shows up when you’re too deep in the suck, the kind you never have to ask. The realization breaks through Quincy’s defenses; she admits she chose not to see it. She thanks Lesha, decides, and places the last Sykotiq vial in Lesha’s hand, promising to find more. Lesha doses, the withdrawal easing. Quincy internalizes an ethic voiced from her caravan days—“Trust is earned, but loyalty is demonstrated”—and claims the mess as hers: Chase’s recovery, Demmy’s hollowed trauma, and Lesha’s dependency. She will not walk away; she will lead and provide. The scene cements Quincy’s pivot from lone mission-seeker to responsible anchor for her wounded team.",
