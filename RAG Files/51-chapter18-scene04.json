    "full_scene_clean": "The caravan was nearly ready. Jeb McTanner watched TRG crews secure cargo while mechanics made last-minute adjustments, electric motors whining. He was about to give the order to move when Master Scrivener Francis called. Francis relayed that the chancellor had changed her mind: Chase was to remain in Tactical Response. Jeb, stunned and angry, said he had just torn the boy down at her demand and worried Chase would see through being used. Francis was breezy—“everyone is being used”—and cut the line. Jeb slammed his fist into a truck’s grill, muttered that the boy deserved better, and headed back to the med bus to face him.",
    "dense_recap_250w": "At the Three Shovels site, TRG teams finalize preparations to convoy out with salvaged assets. As Jeb McTanner is about to roll, his com stud pings: Master Scrivener Francis, speaking for Chancellor Margdelain, orders a reversal—Chase must stay in the Tactical Response Group. Jeb reels; hours earlier he carried out Margdelain’s directive to terminate the young man’s apprenticeship and delivered a hard reprimand. He protests that Chase is fragile and will recognize the political manipulation. Francis dismisses the concern, saying Chase is a hero now and that everyone is being used, then ends the call. Frustrated and conflicted, Jeb vents on a truck grill, then heads back to the med bus (the Dorothea Dix) to speak to Chase. The scene spotlights institutional expedience overruling field leadership, and sets up an emotionally volatile conversation where Jeb must undo his own words for reasons he does not respect.",
