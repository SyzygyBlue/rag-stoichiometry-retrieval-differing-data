    "full_scene_clean": "Rumors that Quincy and Chase were captured at the Calum-Tam Holdfast reach Demmy before he visits Evelyn. He considers going but decides Evelyn needs him more. As she sleeps on his arms, he reflects that making her feel safe is the best compliment. She wakes; quiet intimacy builds, but Evelyn stops and asks what is happening between them. She admits strong feelings, fear, and a need to slow down—no bed, not yet, suggesting lunch, a walk, or exploring corridors instead. Demmy feels confused and rejected but agrees to leave for a bit. At the door, he silently hopes she will ask him to stay; she doesn’t. He exits, planning to be back in a couple of days and thinking about borrowing a TEG-6, recalling he still has the activation chip. He heads toward the motor pool.",
    "dense_recap_250w": "Demmy learns that Quincy and Chase may be captive at the Calum-Tam Holdfast but prioritizes visiting Evelyn, deciding she needs him more. While holding her as she sleeps, tenderness edges toward deeper intimacy. Evelyn pulls back, acknowledging that her emotions are volatile after recent trauma and asking Demmy to slow down: no being in bed together yet, but yes to time together like lunch, a walk, or exploring corridors. Demmy, inexperienced with relationships, misreads the pause as rejection and struggles to regulate his own feelings. He chooses to honor her boundary by giving space, promising to return in a couple of days. As he leaves, he hopes she will ask him to stay but she cannot find the words. Seeking distraction and a way to help others he owes, Demmy turns his thoughts to action: he considers borrowing a TEG-6 vehicle, noting he still has its activation chip, and heads for the motor pool. The scene clarifies consent and pacing in Demmy and Evelyn’s relationship, balances care with duty, and sets up Demmy’s next move toward a possible rescue attempt.",
