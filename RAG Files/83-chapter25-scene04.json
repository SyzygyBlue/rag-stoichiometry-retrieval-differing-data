    "full_scene_clean": "Before dawn, a guard bangs a club on doors to wake prisoners. Quincy pulls the loose brick to check on Chase; he’s wrecked but claims it was worth it. They’re marched to the courtyard with about thirty others, issued wooden bowls and tin cups for porridge and water. Lenya Tam arrives in breeches, boots, waistcoat and a pistol belt, clipboard in hand. Her gaze locks on Chase’s blood-crusted shirt and bruised face; she demands to know what happened. A nearby guard stays silent under her stare. Lenya steps to Chase and orders him to speak. He gambles on audacity, quipping, “must have cut myself shaving,” holding eye contact. For a beat her composure cracks—an eyebrow, a twitch of a smile—then she turns and leaves. Chase reads it as a win and looks down, careful not to seem cowed. Now they wait to see what the reaction sets in motion.",
    "dense_recap_250w": "Roused by a guard pounding clubs on doors, Quincy checks on the battered Chase through the loose brick between cells. He insists the beating was ‘worth it,’ echoing last night’s plan to leverage Lenya Tam’s prior interest and authority. The prisoners—about thirty—file into the Calum–Tam courtyard, each given a wooden bowl and tin cup for porridge and water. Lenya appears dressed for command, pistol belt and clipboard telegraphing control. The instant she notices Chase’s injuries, her pleasant veneer hardens into anger. She demands an explanation; a guard wilts but refuses to answer. Lenya closes the distance to Chase and orders him to speak. Chase executes his social gambit: he delivers a dry deflection—“must have cut myself shaving”—with practiced eye contact and just enough insolent charm to force a reaction without outright insubordination. For a heartbeat, Lenya’s mask slips—eyebrow raised, lip curling—before she breaks contact and walks away. Chase, aching but elated, interprets the micro-signal as acknowledgement and potential leverage over the abusive chain of command. Quincy, who had mocked the risk as suicidal, watches the opening unfold. The scene ends on poised uncertainty: Lenya knows someone hurt a prisoner under her watch; the guard’s silence suggests fear or complicity; and Chase’s visible bruises now function as political evidence in a power game that might change their conditions—or escalate danger.",
