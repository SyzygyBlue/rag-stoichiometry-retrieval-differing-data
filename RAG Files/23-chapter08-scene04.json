    "full_scene_clean": "Quincy woke alone, surprisingly rested. After a quick breakfast, she headed to the tool truck. Margarite intercepted her with a cloth tape, saying Mama Valorie had sent her to take measurements. Quincy raised her arms while Margarite measured shoulders, waist, hips, and chest, jotting numbers on a slate. Margarite suggested darts to show off Quincy's figure; Quincy agreed only if it improved comfort, not attention. Margarite confided some women were proud of Quincy and promised the best-looking coveralls; Quincy asked for something standard. After Margarite left, Quincy processed the offer with skepticism. At the tool truck, she climbed the ramp, opened her wall cabinet—and found it empty. Her toolbox was gone. As she turned to leave, a horn blared. A shriek cut through camp. The caravan froze. Quincy’s blood went cold as she feared an attack with her tools missing.",
    "dense_recap_250w": "Quincy starts a sale-day morning rested and ready to work, only to be stopped by Margarite, a camp seamstress sent by Mama Valorie to take measurements for new coveralls. The exchange blends encouragement and image politics: Margarite proposes darts to flatter Quincy's physique and admits that some women are proud of Quincy for doing a man’s job, while Quincy prefers not to stand out beyond practical comfort. The gesture feels generous, but Quincy internally flags it as precarious—easy to give, easy to take away. She then proceeds to the tool truck to retrieve her gear; the wall cabinet where she stores her equipment is empty. Her toolbox has been moved or stolen, triggering alarm and confusion. Before she can act, the camp horn blasts and a scream follows, freezing the caravan. The scene ends on a cliff: Quincy, suddenly without tools, confronts the possibility of an imminent attack, amplifying her vulnerability and distrust just as leadership appears to extend a symbolic olive branch via new coveralls.",
