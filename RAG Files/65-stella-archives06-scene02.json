    "full_scene_clean": "Shelly sits back in her study pod, chugging water despite brewing UTI symptoms and a nest of nutrition bar wrappers at her feet. The pod lights dim on a circadian schedule she set, but nothing helps. A PID ping announces: 68%—failed practice for the Forensic Investigator III Certification. She has one prep attempt left; the real test window opens in five hours. If she fails, her brother Randy’s body will be recycled and composted. An investigative-hold request she previously filed under a Forensic Investigator I credential granted 36 months of stay; only 34 hours remain. She heads to the pod’s multifunc and fingers a folded note from the night before her mother disappeared. The handwritten message—on a food bag—rejects Stella, renounces citizenship, tells Lucas to move on, and implores Shelly to keep pursuing the truth about Randy, offering a free-city address (mmichellek_2351090.chey.ppn). Shelly recalls her mother stabbing herself during a session to prove a point to a grief counselor, the ensuing Traumalert response, and a recommended neuroject regimen; three days later, her mother vanished. Exhausted but resolute, Shelly forgives her mom yet commits to justice for Randy. A new notification appears: Forensic Investigator III eligibility confirmed. The countdown reads 33 hours, 48 minutes. She vows to pass, see Randy’s body, and keep digging if the answers fall short.",
    "dense_recap_250w": "Back inside her Metrofederacy study pod, Shelly grinds toward the Forensic Investigator III exam with a failing 68% practice score, a brewing UTI, and a floor littered with nutrition bar wrappers. She has one last chance to prep before the exam window opens in five hours. The stakes are stark: Randy’s body is under an investigative hold she secured using a low-tier FI-I credential; the hold has nearly lapsed—about 34 hours remain until destruction and composting. Shelly rereads a clandestine letter her mother, Michelle, left on a food bag the night before disappearing. In it, Michelle renounces citizenship, refuses to use Stella for communication, urges Lucas to move on, and implores Shelly to keep investigating Randy’s death, providing a free-city address (mmichellek_2351090.chey.ppn) for rare updates. Shelly remembers Michelle’s earlier self-stabbing during a counselor session, the swift Traumalert response, and a recommended neuroject regimen; within three days, Michelle was gone. Hollow-eyed but determined, Shelly forgives her mother while clarifying her own motive: justice for Randy. A PID alert confirms FI-III eligibility with 33:48 left on the hold. Shelly commits to passing, obtaining access to her brother’s remains, and continuing the search if necessary.",
