    "full_scene_clean": "At the reconstructed Ehrenberg–Fort Claudia complex in the former Austrian Alps, the Balance Party’s arch-bridge headquarters hosted a high council session. Prime Minister Johannes Romeijns and twelve senior councilors reviewed an overwhelming 23,921 proposed rule updates for Stella AI. A sealed rule appeared among the submissions—Industry and Humanity had invoked Article 18 to redact it. Councilor Chevalier projected the statute; subsection twenty-one required explicit endorsement by a Balance representative before the submission deadline or the sealed request would be invalid. Aides reported that Councilor Nhan had signed the Article 18 endorsement four months earlier, just before going on sabbatical. Now he was unreachable: he had not checked into StellaNet for over a month—and not even Stella, via the Macrobus lattice, could contact him. \nRomeijns ordered Chevalier to discreetly locate Nhan, verify his authority to endorse, and explore legal options despite the blackout period that barred direct contact with Industry and Humanity. He refocused the group on vetting all changes by Winter Solstice and directed that analysts prioritize ingestion and impact assessment. Breaking with decades of practice, he demanded a full regression simulation integrating all new rules, rejecting reliance on pocket tests. Chevalier agreed to consult operations on the immense compute required. \nAcknowledging SAIR constraints and the need for action beyond normal oversight, Romeijns decided to visit Balance Special Projects at Tahua Outpost, a SAIR-shielded facility inside a dormant volcano accessed via a camouflaged salt flats runway. He scheduled a reconvene at 1000 the next day, descended by floorplate elevator, boarded a podlev, and departed toward a fueled hypersonic jet bound for Tahua to seek answers about the sealed rule and Nhan’s disappearance.",
    "dense_recap_250w": "At Balance Party HQ atop the rebuilt Ehrenberg arch, Prime Minister Johannes Romeijns convenes senior councilors to process 23,921 proposed Stella AI rule changes. An anomalous, sealed submission appears: Industry and Humanity jointly invoked Article 18, which allows redaction only if a Balance official endorses it by the deadline. Records show Councilor Nhan signed the endorsement four months earlier before a sabbatical; now he is missing from StellaNet and even Stella’s Macrobus cannot reach him. Romeijns tasks Councilor Chevalier to discreetly locate Nhan, confirm whether he had authority to invoke Article 18, and explore legal avenues despite a communications blackout with the other parties. While insisting the council proceed with analysis and simulator loading for the visible rules, Romeijns orders an unprecedented full regression simulation of the entire update set, rejecting decades of reliance on pocket testing. He acknowledges SAIR constraints and decides to spend allowance points to visit the Balance Party’s SAIR-exempt Special Projects at Tahua Outpost, seeking clarity on the sealed rule and Nhan’s status. The meeting closes with a plan to reconvene at 1000 the next day; Romeijns departs via elevator and podlev to a prepped hypersonic flight toward Tahua, as operations assess compute capacity and aides begin the quiet search for Nhan.",
