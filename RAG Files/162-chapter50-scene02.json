    "full_scene_clean": "Chase wakes on the clinic table tasting copper, throat burning, still immobilized. Quincy rushes to him and warns the doc still has him on a nerve block. The cybermancer states Chase has a detached retina and must remain still. Quincy adds his left arm was lost to bone infection during the last phase. Panic swells—Fox River’s loss, his mother, his arm, his eye—until Lesha grounds him, promising synthetic parts can make him whole. She takes charge, querying the doc about a replacement arm: an Arthrobotics GL-7Q with graphene–titanium laminate, small-caliber bulletproofing, and smart-touch sensory matrix. No carboronitride hyperlaminate is available in Broken Bow. For the eye, the doc recommends sleeving the damaged retina to a corneal display—both eyes for balance—and suggests printing an HID pattern in the mouth plus a microdot controller. After a brief holocred discussion, Quincy says, “Do it.” Overwhelmed, Chase begs to sleep and trusts Quincy and Lesha to decide. Lesha authorizes; the doc’s metal fingers settle on Chase’s shoulder and he’s sedated again, terrified by the loss of control yet clinging to the hope he’ll wake more complete.",
    "dense_recap_250w": "Chase regains consciousness in the Broken Bow cybermancer’s clinic, still immobilized by a nerve block. The cybermancer explains Chase has a detached retina and must remain still; Quincy reveals his left arm was lost to osteomyelitic infection. The cumulative trauma—amputation, eye damage, Fox River’s destruction, thoughts of his mother—triggers a panic spiral. Lesha steps in as the steady voice, insisting he can be rebuilt and quickly pivots into technical triage. She confirms the available prosthetic: an Arthrobotics GL-7Q forearm/arm with graphene–titanium laminate, lightweight and small-caliber bullet resistant, with a graphene sensory matrix. When she asks about higher-spec carboronitride hyperlaminate, the doc scoffs—no such luxury in Broken Bow. For vision, the doc advises sleeving the damaged retina to a corneal display and fitting both eyes for vestibulo-visual balance; he further proposes printing an intraoral HID pattern and adding a microdot controller for interface/control. Quincy agrees to the plan after a brief cost exchange. Overwhelmed, Chase pleads to be put under and authorizes Quincy and Lesha to decide on his behalf. Lesha instructs the doc to proceed. As the cybermancer sedates him, Chase’s last thought is fear at ceding control mixed with a fragile hope he’ll wake closer to whole.",
