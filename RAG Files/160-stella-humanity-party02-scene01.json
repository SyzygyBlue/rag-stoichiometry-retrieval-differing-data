    "full_scene_clean": "Inside a Faraday-caged room at Humanity Party Headquarters over Jinbar Falls, Chairman Giles Montague plugs a fiber-optic comms cluster into a concrete table, projects an archaic keyboard, and initiates a CF-67–encrypted call. Marcus Jessop appears on the screen, haggard and grief-stricken. He laments Makko’s atrocities and questions why the killer must be kept alive. Giles, calm and persuasive, insists Makko is a means to an end: building a vast ravager army to create more Wildlanders and, ultimately, to harness the Metrofederacy in order to destroy it. Giles and Marcus are blood brothers, adopted into different families; Giles leverages that bond and Marcus’s faith, recasting him from “sheep” to “lion.” After a long exchange, Marcus yields and asks what to do; Giles explains the plan. When the call ends, Giles reflects that Marcus’s faith is his blind spot and accepts that neither may survive the mission. He pours tea, disables the camera, engages voice distortion, and places a second, costly encrypted call—to Makko, his Blacklight Syndicate operative.",
    "dense_recap_250w": "Giles Montague, Chairman of the Humanity Party, conducts a CF-67–encrypted conversation from within a Faraday cage at Humanity HQ above Jinbar Falls. He reaches Marcus Jessop—his blood brother—who is devastated by the annihilation of Fox River and furious that Makko, the ravager warlord responsible, remains in play. Marcus pleads that Makko is a monster they should not support. Giles counters with calculated empathy and a ruthless framework: Makko is a temporary instrument necessary to expand a ravager army and generate the chaos (and Wildlander populations) needed for Humanity’s larger objective—subverting and ultimately destroying the Metrofederacy by harnessing it like a ‘lion’ against another ‘lion.’ Giles reframes Marcus’s grief and faith into duty, urging him to accept the cost and take his place as a ‘lion.’ Marcus, after sobbing and wrestling with guilt, nods and asks for instructions. Giles details tasks (not specified on-page) and ends the call, privately acknowledging Marcus’s blind spot—faith—and the likelihood that neither brother survives their cause. He then disables video, applies voice distortion, and initiates a second encrypted call to Makko, identified here as Giles’s Blacklight Syndicate operative, signaling further operational escalation.",
