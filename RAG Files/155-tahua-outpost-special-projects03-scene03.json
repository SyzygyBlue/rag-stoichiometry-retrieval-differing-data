    "full_scene_clean": "Li Mei entered the incubation room, cane’s silver tip tapping the polished floor. Technicians cleaned the recently decanted incubation tank. Skree lay unconscious in a transport chamber, washed and dressed to match her VR exit, bruise and all. “Is she ready?” Li Mei asked, eyes on Fay. “All but the cred chip we’re implanting,” Fay said. An aide handed Fay a small plastic case. “Stop!” Li Mei snapped, slamming the cane tip. Fay withdrew her hand; the original case had slipped into a pocket fold via sleight-of-hand. “I was just getting the injector tool,” she said. “Don’t move.” An aide retrieved from Fay’s pocket an injector and a second case. “Inject the chip,” Li Mei ordered a different aide. “Use our injector, not hers.” The aide opened the plain case, inserted the chip, and clicked it into Skree’s wrist. A scan flashed green. Fay smirked inwardly: the chip was a perfect forgery carrying the right credentials plus her hidden payload, prepared earlier by siphoning the real chip’s data. “Good,” Li Mei said. “Package her for courier to Broken Bow Free City. Handlers will take over; the chip funds basics but forces her to work. No transmissions out, and absolutely no contact with the asset.” The dolly rolled Skree away. Techs finished sanitizing the pod and floor. Four orderlies escorted Fay back toward her lab. Hands in pockets, Fay fingered a hidden button-sized 1 cm box, savoring the con. She accessed a jump node via Utility Chiller 13 to check a honeypot laid for Randy’s sister—two active pings. “Gotcha,” she whispered. With Li Mei busy, Fay planned to move. In her quarters, the door sealed. Lights dimmed gold. A dojo tri-D feed flickered: her “gladiators” stretching, hex-patterned skin gleaming. A maintenance cart drone crawled above in a service tunnel ferrying doom on a timer; code release: Status—OK. Seven hundred meters. Six minutes, twenty-eight seconds. System monitors showed clean relays from waste and overhead duct repeaters. Nude, Fay settled on a leather couch, switched to full tri-D immersion, and started a recorder wired to processors and storage embedded in her body. Her favorite fighter’s optical processor carried her ephemeral malware, planted via his shave-cam weeks earlier. A countdown scrolled; at zero, barely perceptible light flicker would trigger the code. Everything in motion.",
    "dense_recap_250w": "In a sterile incubation room, Li Mei supervises the implantation and verification of Skree’s ident/cred chip while suspecting Fay of sleight-of-hand. She thwarts an immediate swap by ordering her own injector used and having aides retrieve items from Fay’s pocket. However, Fay had previously cloned and re-flashed the real chip’s data, ensuring the chip now embedded in Skree is a convincing forgery carrying her clandestine payload. Li Mei outlines the operational plan: Skree will be couriered to Broken Bow Free City with enough holos to survive but not thrive, monitored by agents and steered by handlers; no transmissions or contact with the asset are allowed. Skree is rolled away, the pod is sanitized, and orderlies escort Fay out. En route and then in her private quarters, Fay confirms covert infrastructure: a jump-node via Utility Chiller 13, a live honeypot baiting Randy’s sister, clean status pings from a waste relay and duct repeater, and a maintenance cart drone on a timed course to deliver an unspecified payload. She also readies a parallel exploit against her favorite dojo “gladiator,” whose optical processor carries self-erasing malware planted earlier via a shave-mirror camera; a subtle light pattern will trigger the code. Fay initiates full tri-D immersion and internal recording with hardware embedded in her body, relishing her layered manipulations while everything moves toward timed execution.",
