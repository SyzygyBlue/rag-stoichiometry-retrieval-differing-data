    "full_scene_clean": "In a hidden Teragen lab inside Deception Island’s volcanic core, Romuald Anwar meets with Deepak, Xiaofeng, and Qasim amid the ozone-and-sulfur tang of water-cooled server halls powered by a geothermal plant. Stella is live but scaling poorly; accuracy is being propped up by thousands of human auditors and cannot keep pace. The Humanity Party plans to open far more immigration slots in the next rules cycle, threatening exponential growth in evaluation complexity across education, housing, healthcare, recreation, and jobs. Qasim sketches the systemic overload on a virtual whiteboard via his PID; Deepak notes SAIR data shows too few citizens are willing to do the tedious, draining auditor work despite high compensation. The team debates a radical idea: contracting Wildlanders as triple-blind human auditors. Xiaofeng objects on security and principle; Deepak warns of public-relations fallout; legal barriers forbid non-citizen recruiting without a council amendment. Frustration mounts, the meeting adjourns, and Romuald resolves to consult Chairman Adlawan. Alone, he reveals (to himself) that human auditors are closer than his team knows; he intends to shield them while a Machiavellian plan proceeds.",
    "dense_recap_250w": "At Deception Outpost, a clandestine Teragen facility inside Deception Island, CEO Romuald Anwar and his senior team review Stella’s fragile state. Although Stella governs the Metrofederacy at scale, its accuracy still depends on thousands of human auditors. With the Humanity Party pushing to expand immigration in the next rules cycle—well beyond the hundred million recently integrated—the team fears exponential growth in allocation complexity (education, housing, healthcare, recreation, jobs) will overwhelm current models and hardware. Qasim illustrates the compounding interactions on a virtual whiteboard; Deepak cites SAIR evidence that few citizens will take auditor roles, which are tedious and emotionally draining. Xiaofeng rejects turning Stella into a ‘glorified Mechanical Turk’ and decries opening systems access to Wildlanders; Deepak warns that outsourcing would be a PR disaster. Legal constraints also block hiring non-citizens without council amendments. With no viable internal fix identified, Romuald ends the circular debate, planning to consult Chairman Cervantes Adlawan. In private reflection, he hints that a path to human auditors already exists and that he will keep his people ignorant to spare their consciences. The scene frames an ethical and logistical crisis: a governance AI strained by policy ambition, insufficient labor supply for human-in-the-loop assurance, and a leader contemplating opaque remedies to preserve the project—and the social order—it supports.",
