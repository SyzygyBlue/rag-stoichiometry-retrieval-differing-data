    "full_scene_clean": "The vent in Demmy's dormitory clicked open and he climbed out. Evelyn's head appeared but she refused to enter the room, warning they might do something they would regret. They had just spent over an hour in the deepest recesses of the Divine Order of the Sanctifying Flame—an archives room of births, deaths, baptisms, marriages, and a few divorces, boxes stacked by the hundreds, going back nearly to Fox River’s founding. Nothing seemed irregular; only ordinary records. Back at the vent, Evelyn produced a newer handheld device, a small black rectangle, and told Demmy to keep it secret so they could message each other. She reconfigured it and had him enroll his face; the screen turned green with a beep. Demmy worried she wouldn’t have one, but she promised to get another tomorrow. She urged him not to be sad—“We’ve got all the tomorrows in the world”—tapped his nose, mouthed ‘soon,’ and withdrew into the dark crawlspace. Demmy closed the vent, undressed, and lay in bed, drifting to sleep thinking of the sweetness of her kisses.",
    "dense_recap_250w": "Demmy returns through the hidden vent to his dorm room while Evelyn remains within the wall to avoid temptation. The pair had spent more than an hour in a deep, restricted area of the Divine Order of the Sanctifying Flame, which proved to be a large records archive containing decades of vital records—births, deaths, baptisms, marriages, and some divorces—stacked in labeled boxes. They discover nothing suspicious, reinforcing the appearance of an ordinary religious bureaucracy. Before leaving, Evelyn gives Demmy a secret handheld communicator—a newer device than his scavenged datapad—so they can message each other. She configures it on the spot and enrolls Demmy’s facial unlock; the device confirms with a green screen and a beep. Demmy protests that she will be without one, but she promises to acquire another unit the next day. At the threshold, Evelyn refuses to step into his room, saying it would lead to something they would regret, then reassures him that they have “all the tomorrows in the world,” mouths ‘soon,’ and disappears back into the maintenance crawlspace. Demmy closes the vent, undresses, and falls asleep, his thoughts lingering on Evelyn’s kisses. The scene cements covert communications, affirms the present lack of incriminating evidence in the archives, and advances Demmy and Evelyn’s burgeoning intimacy alongside operational caution.",
