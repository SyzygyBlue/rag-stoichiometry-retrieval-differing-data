    "full_scene_clean": "Demmy lies unconscious in a Fox River intensive care bed, breathing tube taped to his face and IV bags dripping fluids. Monitors beep in time with his shallow breaths. During shift change, an outgoing nurse briefs the incoming nurse: name unknown, listed as a skerv John Doe the TRG pulled from a ravager raid; injuries include liver lacerations, a punctured lung, and massive blood loss. He was nearly lost on the flight—no pulse for about twenty seconds—before being resuscitated with chest compressions and vasopressors. He is extremely thin and was completely shaved due to heavy lice infestation; his infested clothing was incinerated, while his electronics are stored in the bedside table. The plan: close watch overnight, bandage changes at 0400, broad-spectrum antibiotics continuing, and antiparasitics/dewormers to follow when stable. If he survives, Fox River policy could grant him residency, ending his life as a skerv. The incoming nurse authenticates the handoff with a fingerprint and takes over care.",
    "dense_recap_250w": "At 2300 hours in the Fox River ICU, nurses hand off care for an unidentified skerv—Demmy—rescued by McTanner’s TRG after a ravager raid. He lies sedated and intubated, supported by IV fluids and monitors. The outgoing nurse summarizes a critical course: emergency surgery for liver lacerations and a punctured lung, severe blood loss, and a near-arrest during medevac requiring chest compressions and vasopressors for roughly twenty seconds before return of circulation. Because of heavy lice infestation, he was fully shaved and all clothing destroyed; his electronics remain secured in the bedside table. The incoming nurse notes his emaciation but also the policy implication—survival could grant permanent residency in Fox River, ending his status as a skerv. Orders include ongoing broad-spectrum antibiotics, vigilant infection watch, scheduled bandage changes at 0400, and later antiparasitic and deworming treatments once he stabilizes. The handoff is authenticated by fingerprint on a datapad, and the new nurse commits to close observation. The scene quietly reframes Demmy’s arc from battlefield chaos to fragile convalescence, highlighting triage protocols, social mobility via survival, and the thin line between death and a second chance inside Fox River.",
