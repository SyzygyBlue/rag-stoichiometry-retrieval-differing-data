    "full_scene_clean": "They sat across from each other on a scuffed plastic bench at a sidewalk falafel stand, cumin and fried oil in the air. Above, synthetic sky panels glowed a soft lavender that tried too hard to be dusk. The pigeons were real—pecking wrappers, staring with dead eyes. Lucas ate slowly, eyes down. Shelly picked at a pita, tahini soaking through and running over her fingers. “These are still good,” Lucas said. “Yeah. I come here sometimes. After work,” she answered. Silence. She tried, “How’s the work stuff?” He shrugged: puzzles in virtual, some drafting, documentation—“not rocket science.” More silence. “You seeing anyone?” he asked. “No. No one lines up to date a hard-headed forensic investigator.” He barely shook his head when asked the same. She looked at him: sallow skin, weight lost, half-trimmed gray beard, fingers stained with model paint shredding a napkin. “I miss when we used to talk,” she said. “Me too,” he answered. They binned half their pitas. On the walk back, they said little. His block was tall and plain, rounded corners, hedge out front. At the elevator, he paused. “Thanks for the food.” “Sure.” “Dad? You doing okay?” “Yeah, Shel, I’m fine.” After a shared shrug, he stepped into the lift; the doors slid closed. She stared at the brushed steel, hearing the quiet motor hum, imagining him already lost in an engineering puzzle. She sighed and walked with no destination, falafel grease on her jacket. Overhead, a mourning dove called.",
    "dense_recap_250w": "Shelly meets her father, Lucas, at a modest sidewalk falafel stand beneath synthetic sky panels mimicking dusk. Their conversation is stilted: Lucas describes his work as building virtual ‘puzzles’ with drafting and documentation, while Shelly jokes about her undateable, hard-headed investigator persona. Between long silences, she notes troubling signs—he looks thinner, sallow under strip lights, with a patchy gray beard and paint-stained, fidgeting fingers. She admits she misses when they used to talk; he quietly agrees. After discarding half-eaten pitas, they walk to his unadorned housing block. At the elevator, Shelly checks on him—he says he’s fine. They exchange a small, mirrored shrug before he steps into the lift and the doors close. Shelly lingers at the brushed steel, hears the motor hum, imagines him already drifting back into solitary engineering problems, and then wanders away without a plan, still smelling falafel grease as a mourning dove calls overhead. The scene centers muted affection, distance, and the difficulty of connection between an adult child and a withdrawn, possibly declining parent within an engineered urban atmosphere.",
