    "full_scene_clean": "Margdelain shrugged off her jacket, dropped into her desk chair, and poured a finger of honey-colored whiskey into a rocks glass. The burn matched the turmoil in her head. She tapped a manicured nail on polished pine, mind racing through scenarios, allies, and pressure points. The council vote and Metrofederacy petition had been within reach—now shattered. She forced the anger down. Jessop had flipped her son’s recklessness into heroism and used it to derail her push. Councilman Bivualier had vanished after the meeting—likely hidden while Jessop’s side cleaned up his financial irregularities. She thought of Ransom Canyon and its rising warlord, Makko; Fox River could not stay isolated forever. Progress, security, prosperity—joining the Metrofederacy was the only real shield. She swirled the whiskey and asked herself how to use the setback. She would lean into optics: play the doting mother, pin a medal on Chase, and milk the narrative, while leveraging Broder Willis’s algae bioreactor breakthroughs as a bargaining chip to make the petition irresistible. She tapped the com stud behind her ear. Francis answered, dryly noting that Chase had become a celebrity and that the town was already planning parties. She grimaced, asked for the real vote math, and prepared to pivot her strategy.",
    "dense_recap_250w": "Alone in her office after the council session, Chancellor Margdelain tries to convert a political setback into an opportunity. Brother Jessop has reframed her son Chase’s disobedience as heroism, winning a standing ovation and a motion to adjourn that stalls her Metrofederacy inquiry. Councilman Bivualier—recently pressured by Margdelain—has disappeared, likely sequestered by Jessop until his suspicious transfers are sanitized. Margdelain’s internal calculus blends policy and optics: Fox River faces external threat from Ransom Canyon and its ascendant warlord, Makko, and she believes only Metrofederacy alignment can deter invasion. She resolves to use the new public narrative, acting as proud mother to neutralize the trap, even pinning a medal on Chase if necessary, while foregrounding Broder Willis’s algae bioreactor breakthroughs as a strategic bargaining chip. Over a whiskey, she contacts Master Scrivener Francis via her com stud; he reports that Chase’s legend is already fueling citywide celebration plans. Margdelain asks for a hard reassessment of votes and pathways, determined to regain momentum quickly. The scene details her ruthlessly pragmatic mindset: narrative control over truth, coalition-building, and converting personal optics into leverage against Jessop’s theocratic bloc.",
