    "full_scene_clean": "Quincy inspects the buggy’s motor and recoils from scorched wiring—the entire phase is slagged. She reassembles the housing and concludes they must travel slowly or risk burning the motor completely. Demmy observes they will eventually face something they can neither fight nor outrun. Quincy finishes checks and asks Demmy to find a defensible camp. They eat ration, discuss water scarcity, and Quincy demonstrates a drip filter that can make safe water from clean sources. Demmy recounts attempting the Metrofederacy entrance test years ago; distance and transport made it moot. They speak about trust; Quincy hands Demmy the .45 for first watch, he warns that unconditional trust is dangerous in the wilds. They sleep and resume travel, needing multiple solar charging stops. Spotting black smoke, they approach cautiously and find a ravager six-seater wreck. Quincy salvages a battery and a likely solar charging mat, then they move on. At dusk they discover signs of a hidden family; Quincy offers rations for information. The family confirms a large caravan passed 6–8 hours earlier, chased by ravagers. A child reports a nearby ravager two-seater with one wounded man and another watching. Quincy proposes taking the risk to steal their motor to fix the burned coil and regain speed. Demmy agrees with conditions: night approach, knives first, pistol only if necessary, and Quincy follows his steps. Quincy equips a backup night-vision loop. They depart to hunt ravagers and try to capture a working motor.",
    "dense_recap_250w": "Quincy’s motor repair hits a hard limit: a phase is fully slagged, and the remaining phases are heat-weakened. She reassembles the buggy and commits to slow travel to avoid stranding, while Demmy warns that at some point they’ll face a threat they can’t fight or flee. At camp, Quincy demonstrates a drip filter, easing water concerns, and the two trade views on the Metrofederacy and survival; she entrusts Demmy with the .45 for first watch after a frank conversation about conditional trust. The next day they roll again, making solar stops. A black smoke wisp draws them to a ravager six-seater wreck where Quincy quickly salvages a battery and a compact solar charging mat. Later, they encounter a hidden refugee family who, in exchange for ration, report the Three Shovels caravan passed 6–8 hours earlier while under pursuit. The family’s boy also reveals a nearby ravager two-seater with one guard and one gravely wounded man. Quincy argues they must seize the opportunity: ambush at night to steal the motor to fix their burned coil and recover speed before they fall too far behind to predict the caravan’s route. Demmy agrees on tactics—silent approach, knife work, pistol as last resort—and Quincy produces a backup night-vision loop so both can see. They set out to attempt the risky raid.",
