    "full_scene_clean": "No matter how hard they scrubbed, the wooden floor of the Wildebeest still held the scent of a barnyard. A cool breeze whispered through the sideboards. Two new bodies lay in the distance: an old man who had fallen, and a starving tan-skinned woman who never rose again. At dusk they were dragged to the brush line. Quincy flinched back to the present as Even-Odds dice and a jug of puro went around. She rolled, lost, and drank for distraction, haunted by the day’s refusals at the water tables. Afterward she returned to her tent and found Robyn weeping. Robyn demanded a promise: that Quincy would stay calm, not leave the tent, and just talk. Then Robyn delivered the blow—Mama Valorie said Robyn must marry Gavin “for the good of the caravan.” Rage surged in Quincy, but promises mattered. Robyn asked for another promise: no fighting the leadership or Gavin, no schemes or rebellion, because exile was a real risk. Quincy argued to run, to resist; Robyn insisted running meant death as a skerv and that silence was the only survivable path. Finally, devastated, Quincy promised. They held each other through the night, clinging to what little they could keep. At first light, Robyn dressed, gave Quincy a final, aching smile, and slipped out into dawn.",
    "dense_recap_250w": "At night in the Three Shovels Caravan, Quincy tries to drown the day’s guilt at the Wildebeest dice game, remembering the dead and the desperate turned away from the water tables. She returns to her tent to find Robyn in tears. Robyn extracts a promise that Quincy stay calm and not leave, then reveals Mama Valorie has decreed Robyn must marry Gavin for the caravan’s political good. A second, harder promise follows: Quincy must not fight or confront leadership (Mama Valorie, Davian) nor Gavin, nor attempt any clever plan; exile is the likely punishment, as with Marco before. Quincy argues to resist or run into the wildlands together; Robyn counters that would be a death sentence and insists survival means secrecy and acquiescence. Torn between rage and love, Quincy collapses and finally promises. They spend the night together, making private vows that cannot change the outcome, only buy them stolen hours. At dawn, Robyn leaves with a final smile. The scene frames personal love against communal survival, exposing the caravan’s harsh social control and the cost of compliance.",
