    "full_scene_clean": "Quincy paces her cell, sleepless and torn between fury, guilt, and urgency after Carl dragged Chase away. She hates that he took a beating covering for her escape attempt, yet knows hers would have been worse if caught lockpicking. Keys jingle; guards return Chase to his cell. One mutters, “we’re not supposed to kill you… not even supposed to hurt you.” Through a loose brick between cells, Quincy checks on him: bruised, hoarse, but alive. They argue—she calls it stupid; he says he protected her hands and their chance to save the caravan. He shows a black eye and hints at strategy: Lenya Tam told Carl to leave him alone earlier; by earning a visible injury (diving into Carl’s fist), he creates proof of Carl’s defiance that Lenya will see at morning rations, potentially shifting power. Quincy challenges the risk of retaliation; Chase frames it as a people-game running alongside her mechanical approach. She presses for speed; he agrees. Quincy haltingly tries to apologize; Chase waves it off: if the gambit works, it helps them both.",
    "dense_recap_250w": "Inside the Calum–Tam Holdfast cellblock, Quincy paces, sick with guilt that Chase took a beating after provoking overseer Carl to shield her failed escape prep. Guards dump Chase back in his cell and quietly note they are “not supposed to hurt” him, implying an order from above. Through a removed brick between cells, Quincy checks his condition. They clash: she condemns his stunt; he argues he protected their best asset—her hands for lockpicking—and any punishment for her would have been far worse than his for singing. He reveals a calculated layer: earlier, Lenya Tam publicly told Carl to leave him alone; by ensuring a visible black eye (he “dove” into Carl’s punch), he’s manufactured evidence of Carl flouting Lenya’s authority. Chase expects a shift in the morning courtyard when water and porridge are served—Lenya may act against Carl—opening a political path alongside Quincy’s mechanical one. Quincy plays devil’s advocate about backlash; Chase insists the “game” is just beginning. They strike a tenuous truce: she pushes to move fast to reach her missing family; he works “the people side.” Quincy starts to apologize; Chase deflects, saying the move might benefit them both if it works.",
