    "full_scene_clean": "As Chase and Lenya step from the warehouse into bright heat, she asks about his mother, Margdelain. He calls himself a scoundrel; she counters he just got everything he wanted by talking. Lenya abruptly kisses him, then tests whether Fox River and the Calum-Tam holdfast could ever work together. Chase says only if the holdfast stops practices that violate Fox River ethics, hinting at slavery and Sykotiq. He presses for the truth behind his capture; Lenya claims it was unplanned, that her father was upset, and says forces beyond the holdfast are involved. She urges deemphasizing Quincy’s role, calling her a throw-away. Chase asserts loyalty to Quincy and to Fox River, argues something rotten ties his capture to larger interests, and asks for information as a trade. Lenya says she’ll speak to her father. She then admits her father warns not to trust Chase, yet confides doubt in their direction: Sean Calum is dead, his family gone with half the holos, leaving only her and her father. She thinks they are on the wrong side and asks for Chase’s commitment. He outwardly agrees to work with her while inwardly agonizing over the lie, deciding it’s necessary to reach the truth. They continue toward retrieving the toolbox.",
    "dense_recap_250w": "Outside the Calum-Tam holdfast warehouse, Lenya probes Chase about his mother’s political skill; he plays modest and she surprises him with a quick kiss, signaling a calculated opening. She asks whether Fox River might someday ally with the holdfast. Chase frames strict conditions: end practices that violate Fox River’s ethics, implicitly slavery and the production of Sykotiq. He then asks for the truth behind his ambush and imprisonment. Lenya says capturing him was never intended, her father was furious, and that there are shadowy interests beyond the holdfast shaping events. She suggests Quincy’s involvement should be deemphasized, calling Quincy a “throw-away,” which Chase rejects, reaffirming loyalty to Quincy and Fox River. He argues that his capture and Quincy’s targeting are connected to something “rotten” and asks Lenya to trade actionable information. Lenya agrees to consult her father, then confides that although her father counsels not to trust Chase, she doubts his leadership: Sean Calum has been dead two years, his family left with half the holdfast’s funds, and now it’s just her and her father. Believing they are on the wrong side, she asks for Chase’s commitment to pursue an understanding. Chase, needing time and leverage, lies—promising cooperation despite internal revulsion—and continues with Lenya to fetch Quincy's toolbox.",
