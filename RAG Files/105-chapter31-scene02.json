    "full_scene_clean": "Quincy and Lenya’s argument spikes toward real anger. Seeing the situation slip, Chase drifts to the autopacker and ostentatiously prods its dead terminal to provoke Quincy’s technical instincts. Quincy shoves him aside and begins inspecting the display and cables. Lesha, slowed by stims, says the display has been dead for years and she has to jack in to operate it. Quincy asks for her toolbox. Chase invites Lenya to accompany him to fetch it so they can talk. After warning Quincy not to try anything, Lenya leaves with Chase. The heavy doors shut, leaving Quincy at the machine and Lesha nearby.",
    "dense_recap_250w": "Inside the decayed agriculture warehouse, Quincy and Lenya’s debate over morality and operations surges toward a fight. Chase, worried the day will be lost, manufactures a diversion by ‘wrongly’ fiddling with the autopacker’s dead terminal to bait Quincy’s expertise. It works: Quincy hip-checks him away and begins a real inspection, probing the dusty monitor, cracked chicklet keyboard, and cable connections. Lesha, sluggish and laconic after dosing earlier, confirms the terminal’s display has been dead for years and that she must jack directly into the autopacker to use it. Quincy requests her toolbox to troubleshoot properly. Seizing the opening, Chase proposes to Lenya that they fetch the toolbox together and talk on the way. Lenya studies him, then agrees with a pointed warning to Quincy not to run. The pair exit, the warehouse doors booming closed behind them, setting up a split: Quincy remains with the machine and a groggy Lesha, while Chase goes to cultivate Lenya’s cooperation. The beat reframes the scene from ideological clash to pragmatic problem-solving and social maneuvering, establishing the autopacker terminal as a likely first repair target and giving Chase private time with Lenya to advance his broader plan.",
