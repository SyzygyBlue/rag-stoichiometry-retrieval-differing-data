Demmy consults Bible (Numbers 35:19-21), resolves to violent action to save Evelyn. Confronts Brother Olafsen, shares evidence (Evelyn messages, Chase’s note), requests delivery to Chancellor Margdelain. Receives flaming-sword pendant blessing; enters ventilation shaft."

    "full_scene_clean": "Demmy finally slept after Evelyn left. Late morning, he woke smiling, warmth in his chest. He stared at the ceiling, incense and candles in the dorm, remembering her laughter, eyes, and fascination. He wished he could smell her on his pillow.\nHe saw the communicator she’d given him, powered it on, and saw two notifications: “User Evelyn enabled Location tracking” and “Three messages waiting from user Evelyn.” His heart pounded. He opened the first:\n“Hey Demmy, it’s Evelyn… I had a fantastic time… I can’t wait to see you again… I haven’t been able to stop smiling.”\nHe dropped back on the bed, whooped and danced, then restrained himself to savor the remaining messages. He ate the breakfast tray left at his door, marveling at how far he’d come. Then he opened the second message:\n“The Order is working with the ravagers… I don’t know what to do… it’s horrible.”\nHis happiness vanished. He opened the third:\n“Help they’re here”\nDemmy burst into the hall. Initiate Vance stood nearby. Demmy thrust the communicator at him, voice shaking, begging for help to use location services. Vance, frightened, navigated the device and opened a map: a dot showed “underneath Fox River,” deeper than known levels. Demmy snatched the device and ran back to his room, thanking Vance.\nHe heard Vance calling for help. Demmy needed guidance. He opened the Bible, searching, and stopped at Numbers 35:19–21. Horror and certainty mingled; tears flowed. He donned his robes. If this path would save Evelyn, God’s will be done.\nBrother Olafsen entered. Demmy confronted him, asking if the Order was in contact with ravagers. Olafsen denied knowledge. Demmy showed Evelyn’s messages and Chase’s note describing corruption, Margdelain, and Councilman Bivualier’s disappearance. Olafsen’s face fell. He admitted Evelyn sought places to show Demmy his faith; he’d suggested the records library.\nDemmy declared: he would “hurt some people real bad,” then save Evelyn. Olafsen read the passage: the avenger of blood shall put the murderer to death. Demmy asked Olafsen to carry the evidence to Chancellor Margdelain. Olafsen agreed.\nDemmy explained wildlanders were being murdered by suddenly organized ravagers; if the church was complicit, he would cut out the rot. Olafsen warned he couldn’t do it alone. Demmy replied he’d killed ravagers with stone and teeth; priests would fare worse. He showed the map again; Olafsen hadn’t known levels extended that deep.\nDemmy gave Olafsen his phone to capture photos of the map and messages for Margdelain. Olafsen offered his golden pendant with flaming sword, blessed Demmy: “May God guide your path.” Demmy answered, “His will be done.”\nWith a penlight, Demmy opened the vent and disappeared inside, the grate clicking shut.",
    "dense_recap_250w": "Demmy wakes late at Fox River elated by Evelyn, powers on the communicator she gifted him, and finds location tracking enabled plus three messages. The first is affectionate; the second reveals Evelyn has discovered evidence tying the Order to ravagers; the third is a plea—“Help they’re here.” Demmy rushes into the hall and pressures Initiate Vance to use the device’s location services. A map shows Evelyn’s signal beneath Fox River, deeper than known levels. Demmy retreats to his room for guidance, opens a Bible, and lands on Numbers 35:19–21—the “avenger of blood” passage—experiencing horror but certainty that violent action may be required to save her. Brother Olafsen arrives, and Demmy confronts him about Order–ravager collusion, showing Evelyn’s messages and Chase’s note alleging corruption, hinting at Brother Jessop’s involvement, and recommending reporting to Chancellor Margdelain while investigating Councilman Bivualier’s disappearance. Olafsen appears shaken, admits he helped Evelyn plan faith exploration spots, and ultimately agrees to deliver Demmy’s evidence to Margdelain. Demmy states his intent to “hurt some people real bad” if necessary and to save Evelyn, describing prior lethal fights with ravagers. Olafsen lends Demmy a flaming-sword pendant and gives a blessing. Demmy equips a penlight, opens the room’s ventilation grate, and disappears inside toward the subterranean levels to rescue Evelyn.",
