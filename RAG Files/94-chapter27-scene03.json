    "full_scene_clean": "\"No, I don't think so,\" Chase said around a mouthful of sausage, then took a swig of beer, grimacing. He chewed slowly, gaze distant. Quincy, still hungry, pushed him: they could escape soon, the wall was nearby—why was he ruining it? Chase countered that they’d tried her plan last night; he saved her and took a beating and couldn’t survive a repeat. He wanted rest and information before kicking another hornet’s nest. Quincy paced the tiny dormitory, furious but worried Carl would kill him if given a chance. Chase agreed Carl was dangerous—another reason not to get caught trying again—and asked for time to heal. Quincy stopped, conceded she might be pushing too hard, and proposed they each work on plans while he rested a couple days. Chase thought someone from the holdfast—maybe Lenya—would come in the morning. Quincy urged him to reveal he was Chancellor Margdelain’s son; Chase warned that would cause panic and panicked people make corpses. Quincy realized they’d be killed and buried; he suggested dropping hints later to make captors greedy but cautious. Pressing for details, Quincy got only that there were too many unknowns yet. She stormed to her room, cursing his arrogance and comparing him to his mother. Leaning in her doorway, Chase said he wished he had more of his mom’s skill; they weren’t in a shallow pond—they were inside the mouth of something much bigger, and he didn’t think it had noticed them yet.",
    "dense_recap_250w": "In their new upper-level quarters at the Calum-Tam Holdfast, Quincy urges an immediate night escape over the nearby wall. Chase, eating sausage and forcing down a skunky beer, refuses: he’s still injured from the prior beating and argues they need rest and intelligence before risking another attempt. Quincy warns Carl wants him dead; Chase agrees that risk is exactly why they can’t be caught fleeing again. She tempers her push, proposing a short delay while both develop plans. Discussing leverage, Quincy suggests revealing Chase’s identity as the son of Chancellor Margdelain of Fox River to force release. Chase explains that disclosure would likely trigger panic; the holdfast might kill and bury them to erase evidence. Instead, he proposes carefully dropping hints later to spark greed without fear, but says there are still too many unknowns to outline a full plan. Quincy, frustrated by his secrecy and comparing him to his mother, storms to her room. Chase stands in the doorway, observing that they’re in the mouth of something far larger than the immediate situation and hopes it hasn’t noticed them yet. The scene solidifies a tactical pause, rejects revealing high-value identity, and frames an impending power struggle within a larger, unseen system.",
