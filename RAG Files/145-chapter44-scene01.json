    "full_scene_clean": "Night settled over Fox River as Margdelain savored council wins and the near-certainty of Metrofederacy membership. She reviewed budgets on her datapad, smiling at progress and assuming this would be the last year she worried about allocations—once the Macrobus outage was solved. A few days earlier, the Macrobus had crashed across Fox River; technicians blamed data volume, but she doubted it. With networks dark, Jeb used runners to fetch messages to the localnet, so all news arrived late. One report spiked her attention: the Calum-Tam Holdfast was under attack by Jessop’s ravagers—odd, given their supposed alliance. She took another sip of whiskey and thought of Chase at Calum-Tam, trusting he would find a way out. \n\nBelow Fox River, a sealed chamber’s computer clicked a relay. Servo valves opened, flooding hundreds of gallons of diesel into dozens of one-ton fertilizer crates, then held to mix. Thirty minutes later, igniters fired. \n\nA white flash seared the night. A shockwave shattered stone, steel, and bodies; a fireball clawed into the sky. Kilometers away, people staggered from beds to witness an orange midnight sun and the rain of debris—metal, glass, and worse. \n\nIn the days that followed, the city was a charred skeleton: acrid air, warped vehicles, and the dead scattered among ruins. Looters pawed through wreckage as vultures gorged, while survivors wandered in shock—calling names into silence. Fox River was gone; more than a city had been lost.",
    "dense_recap_250w": "Margdelain ends a successful day of council work believing Metrofederacy membership is near. Despite pride in budget progress, she worries about a citywide Macrobus crash that has left Fox River in an unusual blackout, forcing Jeb’s runners to shuttle delayed updates to the localnet. A new report announces that the Calum-Tam Holdfast is under attack by Jessop’s ravagers—confusing, given their supposed alliance. She drinks, reassures herself about her son Chase’s resilience, and reads on. Beneath Fox River, an automated device quietly opens servo valves to mix diesel with fertilizer packed into heavy crates. After a timed thirty-minute blend, the computer fires igniters. The detonation obliterates the city center: a blinding flash, a crushing shockwave, and a towering fireball. Debris rains down for kilometers as buildings crumple. In the aftermath, the ruins reek of burned metal and flesh; vehicles are blistered and twisted. Looters comb the wreckage; overfed vultures hop in soot. Survivors stumble through devastation, searching for loved ones and small remnants of their lives. The scene leaves Fox River effectively destroyed and raises questions about the blackout, the hidden bomb system, and the broader conflict hinted by Jessop’s moves at Calum-Tam.",
