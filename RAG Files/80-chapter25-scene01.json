    "full_scene_clean": "Chase labors in the Calum–Tam potato fields, hands blistered and ribs aching, forcing himself to keep his head down to avoid the overseer Carl and his strap. Lenya Tam—daughter of Dinh Tam, co-owner of the holdfast—arrives with a water bucket. Chase executes a preplanned gambit of polite audacity: a measured glance, then steady eye contact as he drinks from the ladle, aiming to spark her curiosity without revealing his identity as the Scion of Fox River. Their brief locked gaze lands; a hint of interest flickers. Carl shouts, but Lenya shuts him down, asserting authority. Chase understands that Carl will remember and likely retaliate. He also feels Quincy’s disapproval from two rows away; her head-on escape impulses won’t work here. The holdfast is highly secured—armed guards in blue coveralls, slaves in brown sackcloth, cameras and constant monitoring. Chase concludes escape by stealth is near-impossible from the pens; access to Lenya is the critical path. Returning to the row, he resolves to cultivate that spark into a conversation and, ultimately, a way out.",
    "dense_recap_250w": "In the Calum–Tam Holdfast’s fields, Chase endures weeks of grueling potato digging under overseer Carl’s watch. He suppresses pain and anger to enact a strategy he’s rehearsed: ‘polite audacity’ aimed at Lenya Tam, daughter of co-owner Dinh Tam. He times eye contact and a deliberate drink from her water ladle to project composure and intrigue without exposing his true identity as Fox River’s scion—a disclosure that could get him quietly killed. The gambit lands; Lenya’s brief smile suggests interest. When Carl bellows, Lenya publicly defends Chase’s right to drink, radiating authority; Carl backs down, but Chase knows the man will remember. Quincy works nearby, angry with Chase; her direct-action approach is incompatible with this place. Chase catalogs constraints: guards everywhere, uniforms that separate slaves from guards at a glance, old but omnipresent cameras, and a businesslike expertise at slavery. From within the pens, escape looks unworkable. He reframes the problem as social engineering: Lenya is the key, and he must build her curiosity into access and dialogue. The scene closes with Chase returning to work, hope rekindled yet danger heightened—caught between Carl’s hostility, Quincy’s mistrust, and the surveillance state of Calum–Tam while he prepares his next move.",
