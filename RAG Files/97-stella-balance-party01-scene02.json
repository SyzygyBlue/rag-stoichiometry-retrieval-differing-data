    "full_scene_clean": "Johannes Romeijns stepped off the swept-wing hypersonic jet onto mirror-bright salt flats under a cool breeze. The elevated white runway vanished into the horizon; to the northeast rose the dormant volcano Tahua. Technicians moved around the aircraft as he headed for a waiting quadrafan, where Administrator Jackson greeted him with a firm handshake. Johannes cut short pleasantries: he needed to meet Li Mei. Inside the quadrafan’s wood-trimmed cabin, attendants poured sparkling water set on Balance-emblem coasters. At Jackson’s nod, the door sealed, electric motors spooled, and the craft lifted and slid toward the volcano. Moments later it glided through open hangar doors and settled inside Tahua Outpost. A dark-blue podlev hovered nearby, ready. Johannes told Jackson he expected thirty minutes with the secretary, asked him to arrange a follow-up glass of red wine, and forwarded schedule details: back on the tarmac by 17:50, wheels up at 18:00. He crossed to the podlev; its side door slid open to plush seats around a metal-topped table. As it eased forward and the door closed, Johannes flicked his tongue against his palate to call up the external view; the shell seemed to vanish, revealing the tarmac and Jackson already conferring with an aide. The podlev banked into a tunnel, descending into the underground complex. With another tongue tap, the interior returned. As the car sank deeper into the earth, Johannes pictured Li Mei’s unreadable face and felt a knot of apprehension tighten.",
    "dense_recap_250w": "Johannes Romeijns lands a hypersonic jet on a camouflaged salt-flats runway near the dormant volcano Tahua and is met by Administrator Jackson, superintendent of Tahua Outpost. Pressed for time, Romeijns declines small talk and requests an immediate audience with Li Mei, the outpost’s powerful and enigmatic leader. The two board a quadrafan VTOL with a formal, understated cabin; attendants handle departure as the aircraft transitions through open hangar doors into the subterranean facility. On landing, Jackson confirms a podlev is staged. Romeijns schedules exactly thirty minutes for the meeting, asks Jackson to arrange a later glass of wine, and transmits his hard deadlines: back on the tarmac by 17:50 with wheels up at 18:00. He transfers to the ovoid podlev, whose interior can overlay an external panorama. Using a tongue-activated interface, he toggles the view to watch the quadrafan bay recede before the vehicle banks into a tunnel network descending deep under Tahua. Alone as he travels, he anticipates the upcoming conversation with Li Mei and recognizes his own unease. The scene establishes precise logistics, chain-of-command protocol at Tahua, and Romeijns’s urgency and control as he heads for a clandestine briefing.",
