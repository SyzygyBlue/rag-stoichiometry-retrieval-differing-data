    "full_scene_clean": "Demmy remembers Evelyn’s promise after the library to take him somewhere secret for answers. She doesn’t contact him all day, then knocks from inside the wall during dinner. He slides the dresser aside, squeezes through the vent, and shuts it behind him so the entry won’t be obvious. In near-darkness, Evelyn hands him a penlight and warns not to aim it toward vents—residents know these crawlspaces. They move through dusty, mildewed passages between stacked containers, skirting pipes and wiring, using labeled markings and ladders at junctions. The maze is vast; Evelyn explains she and other kids grew up exploring it, though accidents made it less common. They pass forgotten toys, supplies, and a huge broken pair of scissors. Demmy reflects that a month ago he would have scavenged it to sell. At a tight cluster of pipes they squeeze around; smudged and close, Evelyn pulls him into an extended kiss. Both rattled and breathless, they agree to continue. She reveals Fox River has below-ground levels few people know about and asks him to keep that secret. When Demmy asks why she’s risking this, Evelyn says the Order is good and wants Demmy to see for himself so he can trust them—and her—without reservations. He protests that he already trusts her; she insists seeing is needed. Demmy agrees, and hand in hand they head for the ladder down.",
    "dense_recap_250w": "Following Evelyn’s promise to show him a secret, Demmy uses a concealed vent behind his dormitory dresser to enter Fox River’s between-wall maintenance spaces. Evelyn equips him with a penlight and cautions against shining it through vents, since many residents know these crawlways. They navigate a dusty, mildewed, labeled maze of container junctions, pipes, and wiring via ladders up and down between levels, passing old toys, construction leftovers, and a massive broken pair of scissors. Demmy notes how life has changed; a month ago he would have scavenged everything. At a tight pipe cluster, an intimate moment blossoms into a long kiss before they recommit to the mission. Evelyn reveals that Fox River includes little-known below-ground levels and makes Demmy promise discretion. Asked why she’s willing to “snoop” on people she loves, Evelyn frames it not as spying but as helping Demmy verify that the Order is good, so he can join without doubt and trust her completely. Demmy insists he already trusts her, but she maintains he must see with his own eyes. The scene ends with them moving toward a ladder to descend, having agreed to continue their covert exploration to resolve Demmy’s lingering doubts prompted by previous warnings.",
