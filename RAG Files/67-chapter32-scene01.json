    "full_scene_clean": "POV: Chancellor Margdelain. She scans reports over lukewarm, over-steeped tea and notes a flash update: caravanner Quincy is in the Fox River stockade for 24 hours after brawling with a TRG man. Another alert: Councilman Bivualier is missing, absent from committee and unpaid. Margdelain broods on the stalled council reconvening and the vote her son Chase cost her. Broder Willis’s algae bioreactor breakthrough—an algae crop yielding exceptional hydrogen off-gas and pressable oil—gives Fox River a narrow, leaking window to apply to the Metrofederacy; delay risks the tech’s strategic value. Determined to move, she opens the urgent report stack. An insistent chime hits her ear stud: Master Scrivener Francis requests contact; Chase is outside with an ‘urgent’ matter about the caravanners’ trucks. She decides against pouring whiskey, clears her desk, and orders, “Send him in.”",
    "dense_recap_250w": "From her office, Chancellor Margdelain triages crises. A flash on her datapad reports Quincy incarcerated in the stockade for a day after fighting a TRG officer—behavior Fox River might tolerate only briefly. More troubling, Councilman Bivualier is missing, having skipped his own committee and payroll pickup. Margdelain’s political capital is strained: Jessop recessed the council a week earlier to amplify her son Chase’s ‘heroics,’ and the first vote on reconvening will be the one Chase cost her. Yet urgency spikes elsewhere: Broder Willis’s algae bioreactor breakthrough—an engineered algae crop that emits unusually high hydrogen off-gas and yields oil from dried husks—represents Fox River’s best near-term leverage to join the Metrofederacy. If the secret leaks, its advantage evaporates; they must apply soon. While considering the reports, her ear stud chimes. Master Scrivener Francis, audibly irritated by Chase, relays that her son is at the door insisting on an urgent discussion about the caravanners’ trucks. Margdelain, choosing discipline over drink, pushes aside the report stack and authorizes the meeting. The scene frames a political clock (application window), accumulating security and governance issues (a missing councilman, a jailed caravanner), and a looming mother–son confrontation centered on the caravan evidence games.",
