    "full_scene_clean": "Quincy asks Demmy which way to go; he points east and lifts night-vision goggles up to his forehead as he and Quincy drag the badly injured Chase along a gravel path. Demmy urges speed—if they are seen, they are finished. Quincy asks about guards; Demmy says they are dead, about six of them. There is a wall ahead, but Demmy has a key taken from a gate guard he killed, and he plans to use a small gate. They pass the looming warehouse to their right. Chase tries to walk, bearing a little of his own weight; Quincy tightens her grip and tells him to support himself as much as he can.",
    "dense_recap_250w": "In the dark exterior of the Calum-Tam Holdfast, Demmy directs Quincy east while they haul an injured, barely-mobile Chase along a gravel path. Demmy flips his night-vision goggles up and warns that speed is essential: discovery would doom the escape. Asked about sentries, he reports the guards are dead—about six in total. A perimeter wall blocks the route, but Demmy has a solution: he killed a gate guard and took his key, planning to exit via a small service gate. Moving past a massive warehouse on their right, they press forward. Chase, battered and exhausted, mumbles that he will try to walk and begins to put some weight on his own feet. Quincy, knowing he can’t keep pace unaided, tightens her grip and coaches him to support as much of his weight as possible. The scene emphasizes urgency, stealth, and the logistics of moving a wounded ally while navigating fixed defenses (wall/gate) and structures (warehouse) during a high-risk exfiltration.",
