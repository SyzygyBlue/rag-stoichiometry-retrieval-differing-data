    "full_scene_clean": "Lenya leaves and Quincy immediately punches Chase, furious he ‘handled’ her with Lenya. Chase swallows his anger and argues they’re in this together, appealing to Quincy’s loyalty and laying out more of his plan: leverage Lenya’s influence and dreams to create sunk-cost commitment, possibly by letting her imagine a future in Fox River with him, so she pulls Dinh on their behalf. Quincy calls it dirty but admits escape now is impossible; she’ll play along and act pissed when Lenya returns. Distant screams and a rifle shot underline the danger outside. They agree on a fallback: if the holdfast collapses, grab any weapon, drag each other if needed, and run. They wait in tense silence for Lenya to return, planning to learn who Lesha is and whether that person can help.",
    "dense_recap_250w": "After Lenya exits, Quincy decks Chase and unloads: she won’t be managed or apologized for. Chase chooses de-escalation, telling her he’d fight if they came for her—and believes she’d do the same. He argues that fleeing now is suicidal and that their best path is via Lenya’s leverage over Calum-Tam and Dinh. He reveals his strategy: don’t run ‘his’ plan—back Lenya’s until she has so much sunk in that she can’t turn back, while fanning her aspirations of life in Fox River with him. Quincy grasps the gambit—calling him a bastard—and agrees it could extract nearly anything if framed inside Lenya’s dream, though she warns Lenya isn’t naive. Screams and then a rifle crack echo through the walls, reminding them of the stakes and hinting at violence elsewhere in the holdfast. They set roles: Quincy will maintain a hostile front when Lenya returns to preserve plausibility; together they’ll probe Lesha (from the agriculture shop) as a possible ally. Morally uneasy but pragmatic, Quincy agrees to the con ‘for now’ and raises the ultimate contingency: if the place goes to hell, they arm themselves with whatever they can find, drag each other if needed, steal a ride, and escape. The scene ends with them waiting, silent, the flickering lamp throwing long shadows while the wind hisses through the wall slats.",
