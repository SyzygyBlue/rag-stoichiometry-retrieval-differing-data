    "full_scene_clean": "Shelly pushes away from the wall of her study pod, joints aching and legs numb after sitting too long. Crumbs from compressed nutrition bars scatter across her standard-issue gray top and shorts with orientation dots; she hasn’t bothered with a skin. Needing the bathroom, she pads to the pod’s multifunctional corner and calls the hygienics menu. A soft click: TOILET — EN ROUTE. Arrival: 00:06. She fishes in her pocket and finds the item she has carried for three years: a precisely folded, worn scrap of paper. As the countdown hits zero and the indicator turns green, she steps in, shuts the door, sits, and unfolds the note. It’s soft, grease- and soy-sauce-stained, originally a Chinese takeout bag. The handwriting is unmistakably her mother’s—sharp loops, cramped spacing, a smudge from a prized ink pen. Paper and pen are unnecessary in the Metrofederacy; the irony is deliberate. The bag had been on the kitchen table among trash, placed where it might be overlooked and recycled. At the top: If you found this, it means fate gave us one last shot at honesty. Shelly swallows and begins to read.",
    "dense_recap_250w": "In a sterile, compact study pod, Shelly forces herself upright after hours of study, body aching and legs numb. She orders the pod’s hygienics unit—its toilet arrives on a short countdown—then retrieves from her pocket a tiny artifact that breaks the Metrofederacy’s paperless norm: a folded scrap she has carried for three years. Inside the multifunction stall, seated on the cool, sanitized seat, she unfolds it. The note is written in her mother Michelle’s distinctive hand on a Chinese takeout bag stained with grease and soy sauce, an analog message crafted with deliberate irony in a world that no longer needs paper or pens. Shelly recalls the dinner and the emotional fallout that followed: the taste of food gone flat under family strain. The placement of the bag among kitchen trash signaled its clandestine intent—something that could have been missed or recycled—underscored by the opening line, “If you found this, it means fate gave us one last shot at honesty.” The scene closes with Shelly beginning to read, framing a private confrontation with family truth set against a society of seamless digital interfaces, standard-issue loungewear, and automated conveniences that highlight the human weight of memory and confession.",
