    "full_scene_clean": "Four hours passed. Realization hit Quincy: she was utterly, completely screwed. After removing the wheel and the bent tie rods, she waited for Demmy to return with their cart. He didn’t. Demmy had walked off with the shotgun and effectively everything she owned on the other cart. It shouldn’t have taken four hours. She refused to believe he’d abandon her… until she faced how little he’d possessed days ago. Those supplies were a fortune. He had warned her about trust. Frustration mounted as she wrestled the carbon-steel tie rods. She strained and battered them with logs—no bend. To have any chance, she’d need to anneal them red-hot, let them cool to remove temper, bend, then retemper—absurd out here. She had no water and only a broken corner of a Three Shovels ration bar. She eyed the puro and wondered if drinking herself to death would be kinder than starving and thirsting—if she weren’t murdered first. Robyn’s face surfaced, maybe lost to her forever. Bitterness coiled around her heart. With no work left to hide in, she sat with her back to a tree and, for the first time since childhood, simply wallowed in misery and felt sorry for herself.",
    "dense_recap_250w": "Quincy waits four hours at the ravager two-seater site after removing a wheel and extracting ruined tie rods, expecting Demmy to return with their buggy and all their gear. He does not. The realization that he may have abandoned her lands hard, especially since he’d warned her about trust and the cart carries a small fortune in supplies for someone who had nothing days prior. Attempting field repairs, Quincy tries to bend the carbon-steel tie rods with leverage and logs but fails; they are still tempered. She outlines the only viable path: heat-anneal to soften, slowly cool to remove temper, bend to shape, then retemper so they won’t deform in use—an almost impossible sequence without equipment or resources. Compounding the technical problem is acute scarcity: no water and only a fragment of a ration bar remain. She eyes the nearby puro, momentarily contemplating a fatal escape from starvation or murder. Emotionally, Quincy spirals, fixating on the likelihood she’ll never see Robyn again. With no immediate tasks to absorb her, she slumps against a tree and allows despair to wash over her. The scene isolates her physically and morally: stranded, under-resourced, and forced to confront the cost of trust and the limits of improvisation in the wildlands.",
