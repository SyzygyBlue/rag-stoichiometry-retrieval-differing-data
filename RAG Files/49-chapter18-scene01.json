    "full_scene_clean": "Quincy lies curled in the dark of a caravan trailer, holding the blanket she and Robyn shared and breathing its fading scent. McTanner has just told her forensics found traces of a fast-acting sedative in the grass and soil; based on Davian’s last call time and dissipation, the quantities must have been huge. Robyn and the rest of the caravan are gone; Quincy is alone. Anger flares, but she forces herself to focus. Davian’s remembered rebuke snaps her from grief. She notes TRG will take the trucks, weapons, and supplies to Fox River. The name Margdelain sticks—if Fox River has answers, that’s where she must go. Decision: go to Fox River, find Chancellor Margdelain, get answers, and find her family. In the trailer’s darkness, after resolving to act, Quincy finally lets herself cry.",
    "dense_recap_250w": "In a dark caravan trailer, Quincy processes the TRG’s forensic findings delivered by McTanner: the grass and soil around the Three Shovels site contain residues of a fast-acting sedative in quantities large enough, given half-life and dissipation, to suggest a mass incapacitation. With Davian’s last call to Fox River as the time anchor, Quincy concludes that Robyn and the rest of her people were deliberately taken, not killed, and that she has been left behind. While TRG prepares to move the caravan’s trucks, weapons, and supplies to Fox River for safekeeping and investigation, Quincy fights the urge to lash out and instead forces herself into pragmatic problem-solving. The name Margdelain—repeated by McTanner—fixes in her mind as the likely center of authority at Fox River. Quincy resolves on a concrete plan: travel to Fox River, confront Chancellor Margdelain, and use any information available to locate Robyn and the missing caravan members. After committing to this course, she allows herself a rare moment of vulnerability and weeps in the darkness, then steels herself to act. The scene frames grief turning into determined intent and sets the next waypoint in the search: Fox River.",
