    "full_scene_clean": "Quincy got up in the morning, dressed, and walked to the warehouse. She wasn't going to bother waiting for Sparkles or Lenya. She figured they had been up most of the night. They had only woken her up a couple of times, and then only briefly, but she doubted they'd slept much. The ability to sleep through almost anything was a caravanner superpower.\nWhen she got in, Lesha was there, seated on the ground with her back to a column. She was cutting up a canned ham and yellow cheese, forking chunks onto pieces of bread that she had sliced up on a wooden board. The aroma of the spiced meat filled the air, making her stomach rumble. Lesha nodded to Quincy and held the can of ham up in greeting. Quincy smiled and walked over, sitting beside the mercenary.\n\"Well?\" Lesha said, handing Quincy a folded chunk of bread stuffed full. Quincy took it.\n\"I owe you fifty holos,\" Quincy said, biting off a chunk. Lesha barked a laugh. Quincy raised the makeshift sandwich a couple of centimeters in a mock toast and said, \"Thanks.\"\nLesha raised a finger in acknowledgment.\n\"And don't worry about the holos,\" Lesha laughed after swallowing. \"We both knew what was coming.\"\n\"Lenya's a screamer,\" Quincy said around the bite.\n\"Figures,\" Lesha said, stuffing a bite of sandwich in her mouth and chewing.\nThey sat silently, Lesha making another round of sandwiches for them both.\n\"I'll get you your holos,\" Quincy said after a while.\n\"Just fix the machine,\" Lesha said, stacking the meat and cheese on the board with the bread. \"That's payment enough.\"\nLesha put the board in a canvas bag and brought out a thermos with two cups, both stained dark. Quincy doubted they'd ever been washed. She didn't figure it mattered. Lesha opened the thermos and poured the cups half full of ink-black liquid.\n\"Caf, merc style,\" she said, handing the cup to Quincy. \"If you haven't shit yet, you will soon. Latrine's over there.\"\nLesha jerked her thumb toward a set of doors by the hydroponics stations.\n\"Janitor's been out for about... ninety years, so don't get your hopes up.\"\n\"For most of my life, I've shit in a ditch.\" Quincy drew the cup to her lips and took a ginger sip. It had the consistency of burned motor oil — and tasted worse. She grimaced internally but forced the liquid down. For some reason, the opinion of this old woman mattered to her, so she concealed her revulsion and took another, more deliberate, sip.\nOver the span of about ten minutes, they sat there, not saying a word. She finished her caf, and Lesha offered to refill it. Quincy declined with a wave, and Lesha smiled, understanding in her eyes.\nThe caf was strong, so it wasn't too long before Quincy's heart was beating rapidly, and not too long after that, she got the tell-tale rumble of bubble guts.\n\"Goddamn, Lesha, you called it,\" Quincy said, handing Lesha back the empty cup. She stood. \"I need to go see a man about a fencepost.\"\n\"Figure it out yourself, girl, I'm not coming in there to save you,\" Lesha barked with an impish grin as Quincy walked quickly away.\nMinutes later, Quincy emerged, figuring she had lost two kilos. Lesha was standing beside the machine, a cup of caf in her hand, seeming to wait for Quincy's reaction.\n\"I would have been happy with just the hole in the ground. You didn't say anything about a hose and running water,\" Quincy said, grinning. \"It was like I was in a hotel.\"\nLesha grinned, drinking whatever was left in her cup.\n\"I'm going to get to work,\" Quincy said, squatting to open her toolbox and pulling out the wrench she would need to reopen the maintenance panels. Quincy spent time going back and forth between the console and the maintenance panel, reading the error codes and looking at the machine's interior, patiently trying to figure it out. She needed to focus, but the caf made her jittery — and thoughts of what progress Chase was making with Lenya other than screwing her senseless kept distracting her.\n\"Issues?\" Lesha asked, walking over to where Quincy was probing the test points with a multimeter.\nQuincy looked up, a bead of sweat running down her nose and dripping onto the floor.\n\"This would be so much easier with a fucking manual, wiring diagrams, component drawings,\" she swore. The error codes were just that...codes. They didn't say what was wrong, and she had to deduce what they meant by plugging and unplugging things to see how the codes changed. She had already started taking notes with paper and pen, and her list of codes was getting long. But the effort wasn't leading to any revelations. She wiped a bead of sweat from her brow, feeling a growing sense of frustration.\n\"I have access to manuals,\" Lesha said, shrugging.\nQuincy instantly brightened.\n\"Where? Can I have them?\" she asked.\nLesha's mouth tightened as her brow furrowed in thought.\n\"Have?\" she said, seeming to mull over the word as if it made no sense. Then she sighed, rocking her head back in exasperation. \"You don't have any implants, do you? Not even opticals. Not even corneals.\"\nLesha looked at the caravanner with a mix of pity and exasperation. Quincy could only shake her head and frown.\n\"Why should that matter?\"\n\"It matters,\" Lesha explained, massaging her temples, \"because they are all online, on the Macrobus. I'm looking at them now on my optical implants.\"\nQuincy stared for a moment — then slowly closed her eyes. She was beginning to understand.\n\"So, they're not something I can physically look at.\"\nLesha shook her head, then paused in thought.\n\"But — maybe Lenya has a pair of AR glasses lying around she can let you use.\"\nQuincy shrugged —she picked up her tester.\nNot asking what AR glasses are. She's irritated enough.\n\"When she shows up, we'll ask her.\" Lesha continued.\nQuincy nodded, then resumed her tests.",
    "dense_recap_250w": "At dawn Quincy heads to the warehouse alone, assuming Chase and Lenya are sleeping in after a noisy night. She finds Lesha already there and the two share canned-ham-and-cheese sandwiches and a brutally strong thermos of “caf, merc style.” Their banter settles a 50-holos wager about Chase and Lenya. The coffee sends Quincy to the latrine near the hydroponics area, which unexpectedly has a hose and running water. Returning, Quincy opens her toolbox and resumes diagnosing the broken autopacker, moving between console and maintenance panels, taking handwritten notes while probing with a multimeter. The cryptic error codes reveal nothing without documentation, and the caf jitters plus thoughts about Chase and Lenya distract her. When she complains about the lack of manuals and wiring diagrams, Lesha says she has access—through optical implants that can view the manuals online on the Macrobus. Quincy, who has no implants, realizes she can’t simply “have” the docs. Lesha suggests Lenya might have AR glasses Quincy could borrow when she arrives. The scene ends with Quincy continuing tests, still blocked by inaccessible documentation but with a possible path forward via borrowed AR hardware.",
