    "full_scene_clean": "Li Mei—petite, cane in hand, eyes like obsidian—meets Prime Minister Johannes Romeijns at Tahua Outpost and escorts him through armored access into Special Projects. A red SAIR warning flashes in his vision as they cross into a restricted zone; he spends party allowances to legalize his presence. Inside a Faraday‐caged interrogation room—drain in the floor, metal tie-downs, copper inlays—signal cuts to zero. Over tea, Li Mei briefs him: Councilor Nhan is likely alive. Logs show Nhan approved an Article 18 sealed rule and then walked alone into the wildlands; signs of a struggle, stolen vehicle and flier, both later found burned; the trail ends in a free city. Whoever took him isn’t chipped and doesn’t play by Stella’s rules. Romeijns wants to alert authorities, but there are none; Special Projects must act covertly. Li Mei argues they need time and leverage: delay the vote by breaking quorum—three more councilors must temporarily disappear. She suspects coordinated Humanity–Industry maneuvering and mentions encrypted traffic between Jinbar Falls and Deception Outpost; Teragen may be involved. She is activating an off-ledger operative—a “world-class cryptowitch”—engineered for loyalty and unaware they work for Balance. Operational security is absolute: no digital trails. For covert comms, Johannes must order snapdragons from a specific macrobus florist at the exact date/time; a fruit basket will signal when Li Mei needs him to return. Pressed for targets, Johannes offers Councilors Barnes, Saddleman, and Onyango, scheduled to visit Emma’s Gorge aquaponics in ~three weeks. Li Mei demands precise timing. She ends the meeting; signal returns as the door opens. Romeijns departs to rejoin Jackson, while Li Mei moves to activate her operative and handler down below.",
    "dense_recap_250w": "At Tahua Outpost’s Special Projects, Li Mei escorts Prime Minister Johannes Romeijns into a Faraday-caged interrogation room and serves tea while delivering a classified briefing. Councilor Nhan approved an Article 18 sealed rule and almost immediately traveled alone into the wildlands; investigators found signs of struggle, tracked a stolen vehicle to a stolen flier, and lost the trail in a free city. Both craft were later recovered burned. The abductors are off-grid (unchipped) and outside Stella’s norms. Li Mei insists they cannot alert anyone and must operate covertly to counter what she believes is a Humanity–Industry push to force the sealed rule. To buy time, she proposes breaking quorum by making three Balance councilors “temporarily disappear.” She also flags heavy encrypted traffic between Jinbar Falls and Deception Outpost and suggests Teragen may be involved. Li Mei will deploy a deniable, engineered-loyalty “cryptowitch” operative with no visible link to Balance. She forbids any digital traces; for coordination, Johannes must place a covert order—snapdragons via a specified macrobus florist—set to the exact date/time when three councilors will be at Emma’s Gorge aquaponics. A fruit basket will be her recall signal. Romeijns, constrained without his infopanel, names Councilors Barnes, Saddleman, and Onyango for the site visit but lacks precise timing; Li Mei demands specifics. The meeting ends as signal is restored outside the room; Li Mei moves to activate the operative while Romeijns exits to keep his schedule.",
