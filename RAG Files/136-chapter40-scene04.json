    "full_scene_clean": "Jeb swallowed his whiskey, eyes on the amber liquid. \"Are you certain it's him?\" he asked. Margdelain checked her datapad: \"Seems the 'Son of Fox River' really pissed off Dinh Tam's daughter. She's taking it out of his hide.\" She added that the caravanner girl was with him and dismissed her relevance, baffled at her son's involvement. Jeb sighed: \"I assume we're mounting a rescue? They're slavers—we could roll over them in an afternoon.\" Margdelain shook her head: Calum-Tam is buddying with Ransom Canyon; a strike risks open war. \"Once we're accepted into the Metrofederacy, none of this will matter.\" Jeb asked for the plan. Margdelain asked about Demmy's training. Jeb said he's with special ops, \"wet work\"—and they might be learning as much from him. Margdelain proposed letting Demmy \"overhear\" that Chase and Quincy were captive, betting he'd drop everything to help. Jeb objected; she pressed, \"And if he were captured?\" Jeb, jaw tight, answered that Fox River never gave him orders—he couldn't implicate them. Margdelain concluded: low risk, high reward. \"Start Demmy practicing in a TEG-6 today. Stock it with weapons and medical; include one of Chase's favorite rifles. I'll leak the rumor; it'll spread like wildfire.\" Jeb drained his glass: \"Let's hope this works.\" Margdelain: \"If it works, I'll owe him another medal—and have the armorer get him a new pair of scissors. From me.\" Jeb noted the blacksmith had already crafted Demmy something suited to his talents and others wanted copies. Margdelain insisted he shouldn't represent Fox River with broken scissors. Jeb's eyes narrowed; he thought, cold-hearted, but nodded.",
    "dense_recap_250w": "In Margdelain’s office, Jeb McTanner confirms reports that Chase—the “Son of Fox River”—is at the Calum-Tam Holdfast and has angered Dinh Tam’s daughter; Quincy, the caravanner girl, is there too. Jeb proposes a direct rescue, calling Calum-Tam slavers and claiming Fox River could crush them quickly. Margdelain vetoes the idea: Calum-Tam is aligned with Ransom Canyon, so any assault risks open war Fox River is not ready to win. Banking on eventual Metrofederacy membership, she looks for a lower-risk option and probes Demmy’s status. Jeb reports Demmy is training with special ops for wet work. Margdelain outlines a deniable intervention: leak a rumor that Chase and Quincy are captive so Demmy “overhears” it and self-deploys. If captured, Demmy cannot implicate Fox River because he was never ordered—maintaining plausible deniability. She instructs Jeb to get Demmy into a TEG-6 immediately, stocked with weapons and medical supplies and one of Chase’s favorite rifles, while she circulates the rumor, expecting Demmy to move by morning. She adds a cosmetic-political note: equip Demmy properly; don’t send him representing Fox River with broken scissors. Jeb notes the blacksmith has already made Demmy a bespoke weapon favored for his work. The scene frames Margdelain’s cold, strategic calculus and Jeb’s reluctant execution of a risky but deniable rescue gambit.",
