    "full_scene_clean": "Quincy jammed her steel-toe boot between the closing door and the frame and shouldered into Chancellor Margdelain's office. The elderly Master Scrivener protested, but she ignored him. Margdelain looked up from her datapad, unbothered, opened a drawer, and set out a bottle of whiskey with two rocks glasses. She poured a finger into each and gestured for Quincy to sit. With both hands bandaged, Quincy awkwardly lifted the glass and sipped, masking irritation per Chase’s advice: never show emotion.\nMargdelain: “I see you’ve been talking to my son. The last time you barged in here, it was a disaster. At least he’s taught you to be civil.” Quincy held neutral. Margdelain cut to the point: Quincy wanted news about the missing caravanners. “I don’t have any you’ll like.”\nOn suspects: Margdelain dismissed the Metrofederacy—if it were them, they’d have taken trucks, not people—contradicting earlier suspicions from McTanner and Inspector Liebold. “Someone else must be behind this.” Quincy insisted she had to find them and that the abduction happened under Fox River’s nose.\nMargdelain added that Brother Jessop and the church had taken an interest and offered to buy the entire caravan as a ‘humanitarian’ gesture to aid victims of the Metrofederacy. Quincy refused: “It’s not for sale.” Margdelain agreed she had told Jessop the same, then clarified: Jessop doesn’t want the trucks; he wants the political leverage. He opposes joining the Metrofederacy and sees Quincy and the caravan as props to stoke fear.\nMargdelain then proposed a counter: Fox River would offer the same sum—no sermons, no strings—so Quincy could hire a cryptowitch in Broken Bow to dig into who took her people. She slid a holocred reader across the desk. Quincy recognized a bidding war and said she might wait and let Margdelain and Jessop fight it out.\nMargdelain warned against delay: political capital fades; storage won’t be free; without acting now, the caravan will end up scrap value, and Quincy still needs that cryptowitch. “You’re going to lose the trucks either way. One way, you get closer to answers. The other… nothing.”\nTorn between pride and the chance to find Robyn and the others, Quincy thanked Margdelain and forced herself to leave before deciding.",
    "dense_recap_250w": "Quincy forces her way into Chancellor Margdelain’s office at Fox River seeking progress on her abducted caravaners after a week of waiting. Margdelain conducts a poised power play—whiskey, controlled tone—and states that current analysis rules out the Metrofederacy (they would have taken trucks, not people), contradicting earlier field suspicions from McTanner and Inspector Liebold. She says an unknown party is responsible. Margdelain reveals that Brother Jessop and the church, opponents of Fox River joining the Metrofederacy, offered to buy Quincy’s entire caravan as a ‘humanitarian’ gesture; the chancellor frames this as exploitation, with Quincy and the caravan as props to fuel anti-Metrofederacy sentiment. Margdelain counters with her own offer: Fox River will match Jessop’s price with no strings attached, specifically so Quincy can hire a cryptowitch in Broken Bow to uncover who took her people. She pushes a holocred reader across the desk and warns that political capital and free storage are short-lived; delaying means the caravan falls to scrap value and Quincy loses leverage without gaining answers. Quincy recognizes a bidding war and considers stalling to let the offers rise, but Margdelain presses urgency: she will lose the trucks either way; only one path funds a real investigation. Emotionally torn—resentful of manipulation but desperate to find Robyn—Quincy disengages and leaves without committing, determined to think before deciding.",
