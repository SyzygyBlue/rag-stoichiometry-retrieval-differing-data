    "full_scene_clean": "Chase wakes to angry shouting in the bullet-scarred med bus. Quincy is tied to a bed, raging at McTanner and insisting the vehicle—named the Dorothea Dix—is her family’s med bus. McTanner stays calm; Quincy accuses him of detaining her to keep her from leaving. Chase, swollen and hurting, intervenes: he reminds them he fought to save Quincy and Demmy and urges cooperation. Investigator Liebold chimes in with a barbed greeting. Chase asks Quincy to provide verifiable proof she belongs. After a tense pause, Quincy directs them to the command truck: slide the driver’s console forward to a hidden latch holding a brass key, a memchip, and a loaded 9mm—orders them to look only. McTanner and Liebold check, return, and unbuckle her restraints. Liebold apologizes for the hold while verification was done. Quincy immediately heads to the back to use a bucket toilet, telling Chase there’s no modesty in caravan life, then returns to the front, gown rustling, and declares she’s ready for questions because she needs to start finding her family now.",
    "dense_recap_250w": "On the Dorothea Dix med bus, Chase wakes to hear Quincy bound and raging at McTanner. She asserts the bus is her family’s and that Fox River personnel are guests, not owners. McTanner remains calm; Quincy claims they restrained her to keep her from leaving. Seeing the exchange going nowhere, Chase intercedes, citing his role in the firefight and asking Quincy to offer something only she would know so TRG can verify her identity and stop wasting time. Quincy relents, giving precise instructions to a hidden compartment in the caravan’s command truck: slide the driver’s console forward to a latch; inside are a brass key, a memchip, and a loaded 9mm—look but don’t touch. McTanner and Investigator Liebold briefly leave, confirm the cache, and return to release Quincy’s restraints. Liebold offers a curt apology. Quincy, unembarrassed by a lack of privacy, uses the bus’s bucket and tells Chase caravan life has no room for modesty. She then steps forward, voice steady, and invites questions on the condition that the investigation move quickly—she must find her missing people. The scene reframes tensions between authority and survivor, establishes a verification protocol that shifts trust toward Quincy, and sets the search imperative.",
