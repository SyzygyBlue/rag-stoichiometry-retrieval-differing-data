    "full_scene_clean": "The radio crackled with a call: “Fox River, Fox River, this is Quincy from Three Shovels Caravan. Do you copy?” Chase, piloting a TEG-2 two-seater in a spiral search, answered and took her coordinates. He swung the vehicle toward the signal, its fat cleated tires and long-throw suspension devouring rough ground while the vibration-canceling cab stayed eerily calm. Quincy warned they were undermanned with ravagers incoming and requested immediate assistance. Chase acknowledged and accelerated. Master McTanner came over comms, first ordering Chase to hold position, then—on a private channel—reluctantly tasking him to scout and report while TRG was five minutes out. If he saw the ravagers, he was to run. Chase, fighting a flicker of doubt, promised to be careful, then focused on the nav path and pushed on, grinning for the first time in a while.",
    "dense_recap_250w": "From the driver’s seat of a TEG-2, Chase conducts an ever-widening spiral search across rough grasslands when a distress call breaks in: Quincy of the Three Shovels Caravan requests immediate help against an incoming ravager attack and transmits coordinates. Chase inputs the data into his nav computer—about twenty-five kilometers north—and turns the Fox River–engineered two-seater toward the signal. As he accelerates, Master McTanner cuts in on the net, first issuing a stand-down, then opening a private channel to acknowledge reality: Chase is already moving. McTanner authorizes a limited role—scout the area and report, avoid contact, and run at any sign of the ravagers—adding that TRG support is approximately five minutes out and warning he does not want to inform Chase’s mother of his death. The TEG-2’s suspension, tires, and active vibration cancelation smooth the brutal terrain while the climate-controlled cab stays steady. Chase, momentarily doubting but determined, confirms he will be careful, stows the mic, and commits to the course. The scene closes with him locked onto the nav path and finally allowing himself a grin, ready to prove himself while balancing risk against orders.",
