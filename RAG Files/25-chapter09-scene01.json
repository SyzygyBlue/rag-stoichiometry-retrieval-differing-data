    "full_scene_clean": "Darkness Fell — 9 October, 2186.\nThe Three Shovels Caravan was on the move. The last truck in the line, an old cab-over called Achilles, lumbered along. Its trailer, thick sheet metal and fat solid-metal tires, served as the caravan’s shield against relentless ravager pursuit. Achilles soaked up a torrent of bullets at the rear while Three Shovels’ machine gunners on elevated platforms unleashed withering fire. Holed ravager vehicles veered off, some trailing black smoke and flame.\nIt wasn’t enough. The ravagers, seemingly endless, kept coming. Then they began to swerve in unison, left and right, attempting to flank and rake the convoy’s sides. The column turned repeatedly to put Achilles between the attackers and the rest of the line. Quincy’s heart pounded—were the ravagers steering them? This level of coordination was unlike anything she’d heard of. If they were herding the caravan like sheepdogs, then there was a plan.\nThirty minutes later, cresting a hill, Quincy flattened atop the Gooch and saw their fate ahead: an encampment of ravagers waiting like an open maw. The hammer had fallen; the anvil was set. The Three Shovels Caravan was trapped.",
    "dense_recap_250w": "On 9 Oct 2186 the Three Shovels Caravan flees across the wasteland under sustained attack. The tail truck, a cab-over called Achilles with armored trailer and solid-metal tires, takes position as the rearguard shield, absorbing heavy fire while elevated machine-gun teams pound the pursuers. Several ravager vehicles are disabled and burn, but the enemy’s numbers do not diminish the pressure. A tactical shift alarms Quincy: ravager vehicles begin swerving in coordinated left/right waves to flank and pour fire into the convoy’s sides, effectively steering the column’s heading. To protect the formation, the drivers repeatedly reorient to keep Achilles between the attackers and the line—an exhausting, risky maneuver that suggests the ravagers are herding them. Quincy assumes Davian recognizes the trap but is gambling that sustained defensive fire will break enemy will before the encirclement completes. After about thirty minutes of this running firefight, the convoy crests a hill. From her prone position atop the Gooch, Quincy sees a prepared ravager encampment directly ahead. With pursuers driving them from the rear and a force waiting in front, the classic hammer-and-anvil trap is sprung; the caravan’s path is blocked, leaving them apparently pinned between two enemy elements.",
