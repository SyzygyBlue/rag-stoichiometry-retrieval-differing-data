    "full_scene_clean": "A scream ripped Quincy from sleep. \"Robyn!\" She lurched upright, scrambled into clothes, and sprinted out of the tent. She ran headlong into Davian. He grabbed her shoulder and told her to listen: if she rushed in, leadership would make her the problem. \"Robyn is fine,\" he said, giving his word. He urged her to go to the Wildebeest, play Even-Odds, laugh, lose some holos, get drunk, and sleep, promising the mess would be cleaned up by morning. Quincy saw the edge she’d been standing on—exile. She pictured refugees and realized one outburst could put her outside the caravan. She chose restraint, told Davian she loved Robyn and the caravan, and agreed to go to the Wildebeest. She asked how it got so bad; Davian blamed pride, weaponized tradition, and stubbornness, and promised to fix it. He left to sort it out. Quincy walked toward the noisy trailer, bitter but resolved: this wasn’t over.",
    "dense_recap_250w": "Quincy wakes to Robyn’s raw scream and charges from her tent, only to be intercepted by Davian. He restrains her and warns that if she intervenes she will be cast as the problem and likely forced out of the caravan. Davian insists Robyn is safe and demands Quincy create an alibi of normalcy: go to the Wildebeest, play the Even-Odds dice game, lose some holos, and sleep. As they stand face-to-face in the moonlit camp, Quincy realizes how close she is to exile and recalls the newly ruined refugees—imagining herself among them if she lashes out. She declares her love for both Robyn and the caravan and, under protest, agrees to Davian’s plan. Before leaving, she asks how things degraded to this point; Davian cites pride, weaponized tradition, and mutual stubbornness, then promises to fix the situation. He departs to “clean it up,” while Quincy heads to the gambling trailer, steeling herself. The scene centers on restraint versus eruption, political optics within the Three Shovels’ hierarchy, and Quincy’s grim calculation to survive the system to protect Robyn.",
