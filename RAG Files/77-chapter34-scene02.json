    "full_scene_clean": "Demmy finishes reading the bedside note and learns Quincy has been kicked out of Fox River. Worried for her, he asks the bearded clinician who Chase is. The doctor says Chase is Chancellor Margdelain’s son, a TRG soldier honored for fighting ravagers with Demmy. Demmy recalls the red-haired sniper and, reassured Chase went to help Quincy, weighs the letter’s request: get close to Fox River’s religious Order. Testing the waters, he asks if someone could pray with him and how soon he can attend a service. The bearded man welcomes the idea, saying the Order will gladly visit during Demmy’s observation and therapy. He shows a pendant: a cross-shaped sword with two flaming snakes twined up the blade, tongues like forks of fire, explaining some serve with a sword and some with sutures. Demmy feigns eager interest while masking distrust of zealots from his wildland past. He debates laying low versus engaging the church to belong—and possibly to spy as the note implied. He chooses the easy first steps: meet clergy, attend services, and see what unfolds. He says he looks forward to it, hoping Quincy—and Chase—are safe.",
    "dense_recap_250w": "In Fox River’s medical ward, Demmy finishes Chase’s letter and learns Quincy has been exiled from the city, which worries him. Unsure about the letter’s veiled request, he asks the bearded clinician who “Chase” is and is told Chase is the Chancellor’s son and a decorated TRG soldier—the same red-haired sniper Demmy remembers from the ravager fight—who has gone to help Quincy. Interpreting the note as a nudge to approach Fox River’s church, Demmy probes by requesting someone to pray with him and inquiring about attending services. The clinician, a member of “the Order,” gladly agrees and displays a pendant symbol: a cross-shaped sword wrapped by two flaming snakes, explaining that some restore the world by the sword and some by sutures. Internally, Demmy struggles: his wildland experience taught him to distrust zealots, and he longs to lay low and simply recover. But he also sees that joining the religious community could grant belonging, information access, and a safe future within Fox River. He decides to proceed with low-risk steps—visits and services—keeping his options open while honoring the letter’s intent. He voices enthusiasm, then privately hopes Quincy and Chase are safe.",
