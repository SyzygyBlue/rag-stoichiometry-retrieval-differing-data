    "full_scene_clean": "Davian enters the Three Shovels command trailer where Mama Valorie and two confidants hover over charts and handwritten documents. He orders the women out; Valorie resists, asserting her authority. Davian presses the issue, pivoting to the real conflict: Valorie’s handling of Quincy. He accuses Valorie of maneuvering Quincy toward ejection—a death sentence—and argues Quincy is an excellent mechanic and contributor. Valorie counters that Quincy rejects the women’s group and its burdens—childrearing, washing, food and garment work—and fears other girls will copy her. Davian dismisses the argument, saying Quincy has always been different and that performance matters. Valorie claims Quincy’s excellence reflects her own tutelage: “She’s one of my girls.” After a tense exchange, Davian again requests privacy; this time Valorie signals her confidants to leave, and the trailer empties, leaving the two leaders alone to continue the dispute.",
    "dense_recap_250w": "In the command trailer of the Three Shovels Caravan, Davian confronts Mama Valorie as she confers with two confidants over charts and notes. He demands the aides leave; she refuses, sparking an immediate power contest. Davian redirects to the core issue: Valorie’s handling of Quincy. He insists Valorie would have orchestrated Quincy’s ejection, which he calls a de facto death sentence in the wildlands, and argues that Quincy is a stellar mechanic and valuable asset. Valorie frames the conflict as dereliction of gendered duties—membership in the women’s group and the labor that sustains the caravan (childrearing, washing, food preservation, mending). She worries that permitting Quincy’s exception invites others to “go off and play mechanic,” undermining cohesion and workload distribution. Davian counters that Quincy has always been atypical and that capability and contribution should prevail. Valorie, stung but defiant, asserts Quincy’s excellence reflects her own leadership: “She’s one of my girls.” The exchange lays bare a deeper struggle between tradition/enforcement and pragmatism/merit. After a final push, Davian secures a private discussion by getting Valorie to dismiss her two confidants. The scene ends with the leadership conflict unresolved but narrowed to an intense, private negotiation over whether communal norms can flex to retain a high-value member without eroding the social contract.",
