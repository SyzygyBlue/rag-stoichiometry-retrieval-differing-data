    "full_scene_clean": "Quincy and a skerv youth sprint from open ground into a thorny bramble, hiding as the ravager camp quiets. The youth—Demmy—keeps watch and urges stillness. He confirms Gavin pistol-whipped Quincy during the earlier chaos. They exchange names and assess options: Demmy argues to slow-evade outward by hops; Quincy insists on finding a vehicle to chase the caravan. They inventory two packs: water, rations, ammo, medkit, filters—and Quincy’s stolen toolbox recovered from Gavin’s pack. Demmy warns that ravagers will torture captives; he presses Quincy to promise a last-resort pact: if capture is imminent, shoot him and then herself. Quincy agrees. After rationing a rich meat-and-berry bar, they debate risk again: Demmy prefers continuous displacement; Quincy, confident in her mechanical skill, targets an old barn ~300 meters away with derelict vehicles, intending to fix one enough to roll and steer to a safer site for full repairs. They settle on Quincy’s plan with a fallback to Demmy’s if it fails, then ready to move, Quincy shoulders the toolbox and prepares to cross.",
    "dense_recap_250w": "Pinned near a ravager camp after an ambush, Quincy and the skerv youth who aided her crawl into a bramble thicket. He introduces himself as Demmy and confirms Gavin struck Quincy with a pistol during the retreat. The pair study the camp and argue strategy. Demmy, practiced at survival, wants to hop between hides until they are outside patrol range, warning that capture means torture; he bluntly says anger can keep you alive but rage will get you killed. Quincy, shaken yet resolute, wants to rejoin the caravan and insists on finding wheels. While sorting supplies from two recovered packs, Demmy reveals Quincy’s stolen toolbox in Gavin’s bag—proof of betrayal. Their combined kit includes water, dry ration bars, ammo, a medkit, and two 100-liter water filters. Demmy concedes to try Quincy’s plan when she spots an old barn roughly 300+ meters away that holds vehicles on blocks; she claims she can quickly assess one and, if it rolls and steers, get them far enough to finish repairs in cover. They agree on contingencies: if the fix fails or time runs out, they switch to Demmy’s evasion plan. Before moving, Demmy makes Quincy promise a mercy pact—if ravagers close in and escape is impossible, she is to shoot him first and then herself. Quincy, grim, agrees. She holsters Andreu’s .45, shoulders her pack and toolbox, and they prepare to move.",
