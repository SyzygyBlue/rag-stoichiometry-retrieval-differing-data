    "full_scene_clean": "Word around camp was Gavin had gone on a puro bender and was now confined to his tent, sleeping it off. Tomorrow was the last sale day before the run southeast to Broken Bow Free City; the Wildebeest overflowed with more than forty refugees who had paid passage. Supplies would run low soon, with holdfast stops planned along the way. Mama Valorie passed by earlier, smiled, and said nothing—a surprising change that gave Quincy a flicker of relief. Tired, Quincy returned to her tent. As she changed, Robyn appeared in the doorway, mischievous and warm. They bantered softly; Quincy lifted the cover, and Robyn slid in beside her. They curled together like they belonged, kissing slow and reverent. Robyn’s touch affirmed what they almost lost; whispered I love yous passed between them. The ache in Quincy eased as tears came clean. Later, they moved together—unhurried, tender, a quiet return to each other. Quincy felt whole.",
    "dense_recap_250w": "In the crowded Three Shovels encampment on the eve of departure, rumors say Gavin has gone on a destructive puro binge and is now confined to his tent. The Wildebeest is packed with over forty refugees who have purchased passage; supplies are tight with several trading stops planned en route to Broken Bow Free City. Mama Valorie passes by Quincy with an unusual, silent smile, hinting at a cooling of tensions. That night, exhausted Quincy returns to her tent where Robyn arrives, playful and certain. The two share affectionate banter before Robyn joins Quincy under the covers. What follows is a tender reconciliation: slow kisses, intimate touch, and quiet affirmations of love. The emotional core is relief and restoration after recent jeopardy—Robyn marking that they nearly lost what they share, and Quincy acknowledging it without flinching. Their physical closeness functions as a mutual vow to move forward together with trust and presence. The scene closes on a sense of warmth and wholeness amid scarcity and looming travel, with external pressures (refugees, supply strain, Gavin’s spiral) contrasted against the private, stabilizing refuge of their relationship.",
