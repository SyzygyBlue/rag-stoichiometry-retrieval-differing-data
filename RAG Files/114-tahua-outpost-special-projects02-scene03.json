    "full_scene_clean": "Third shift. In the simulated workroom, Skree savored near-solitude: server hum, vent hiss, and a muted blue AR circle marking Nikomo’s presence. She left the circle visible to avoid bump-ins. \nJejune: Is this what she sees and hears?\nFay: Yes, exactly.\nA stack of decrypted files lay on her virtual desktop. She flicked her tongue; a glow bar bloomed from green to red as Trauma Stain thumped. After a microdose from her neurochem menu—Riff—colors sharpened; minutes later isolation returned. Shift over, she headed to her apartment, queued a multifunc shower, stripped, AR skins dropping to dull gray beneath.\nJejune: Is this awkward? I feel weird watching a woman undress.\nFay: Is she a person? Better to think she’s property. Be quiet and watch.\nThe stall gleamed. Skree shuddered at a phantom soap scent. “One day, I’ll have my own damn shower.” Fifteen minutes later, dressed and recolored in muted tones, she triggered a benzo/psychostim mix to curb anxiety and set out for the Cryodyne hacker hangout.\nA podlev waited. She boarded; the maglev hummed. The pod coupled into a chain—luminous beads (or streptococcus). A couple entered; she glared until they faced away. At her stop she disembarked into a dim station, hacked her local Stella Runtime lighting to reveal a star-filled sky and smiled.\nJejune: Did she just hack the Stella Runtime?\nFay: Yes. Local only.\nInside the bar, InteractDB overlays popped: names/handles/roles for Cryodyne staff. Biohazard Protocol’s “Biodigital Plague” hit as she bought a Digital Distortion Hazy IPA with a wrist-chip. She sipped, waiting for alcohol to soften the chems.\nFay: Time to load up a problem… and there we are.\nAn amber indicator: message from Culpering—CF-67 intercept from Terracotta Army; urgent decryp needed. Skree downed her beer, left, and caught the first podlev. En route she confirmed CF-67 headers and launched her decryp toolkit; stats and graphs fanned into semi-transparent panes. “You’re not going to give up your secret easy, are you?” Her internal processor ticked past ten billion cps—she’d need more.\nAt the office the door sensed her and unlocked. On the hacker couch, she lifted her shirt, tongued the port release, opened the small abdominal flap, and clicked in the external cable bundle.\nHyper-performance mode: available\n“Gimme the juice,” she whispered, blasting Nanocide and lifting all limiters. Ice-cold coolant surged; heat would follow as her belly-star spun up. Stats spiking, she switched to full VR immersion—and the world disappeared.",
    "dense_recap_250w": "Within Skree’s full-immersion simulation, observed live by Fay and Jejune in passenger mode, Skree works a third-shift decrypt run, easing isolation with Trauma Stain and a microdose of her designer hallucinogen Riff. After her shift she showers in a shared multifunc, expressing discomfort with the lack of privacy, dresses, applies a benzo/psychostim cocktail to blunt anxiety, and rides a podlev to the Cryodyne hacker hangout. Along the way she locally hacks her Stella Runtime lighting to enjoy the night sky. In the bar, InteractDB overlays provide names and roles for nearby Cryodyne personnel. As Biohazard Protocol’s “Biodigital Plague” plays, a priority message arrives from Culpering: a Terracotta Army transmission encrypted with CF-67 needs rapid decryption. Skree abandons the bar, confirms CF-67 headers in transit, and spins up her decryp toolkit; initial processor stats suggest she lacks compute headroom. Back at the office, she connects an external cable to her abdominal port to enable hyper-performance mode with external power and cooling, lifts software limiters, and drives her internal compute system hard while blasting Nanocide. Coolant chills, then the core radiates; with statistics climbing across ghostly panes she drops into full VR immersion to attack the cipher. Throughout, Fay coaches Jejune via sidebar messages, framing Skree’s hacks and habits while quietly shepherding the observation.",
