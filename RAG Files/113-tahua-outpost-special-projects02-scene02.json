    "full_scene_clean": "Fay and Jejune appeared beside one another inside the full-immersion simulation, their bodies ghostly. Jejune flipped her hands, staring through them. Fay pointed toward a dark-haired woman on a sofa. “That’s her… and no, she can neither see nor hear us. We cannot interact with the world in any way. We can only observe.” Jejune stared at Skree. “She’s so… real.” Fay: “What did you expect?” Jejune stepped closer; Skree remained engrossed in unseen work. “You can approach her,” Fay said, passing her splayed fingers through Skree’s head. Jejune squatted to study Skree’s face. “Is this what she’s going to look like?” “Pretty much exactly,” Fay said. “This simulation is the most accurate I have ever constructed, all the way down to pimples, hangnails, and split lips from rough sex.” Skree sipped from a cup, grimacing. A plump, dark-haired woman entered, sighed, and sat elsewhere. “Who’s that?” “Nobody, pure simulation.” Jejune hesitated. “Can… Skree have sex?” Fay: “All she wants, but she’s infertile. We removed her uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries. That is where we installed the computer core—about the size of two thumbs—plus solid-state polymer batteries, power couplers, insulation, and cooling. Ten to the 12th calculations per second at idle. If she tackles a hard cryptographic problem she can jump to ten to the 21st in extreme mode, but then she must use external power and external cooling.” Jejune: “How can she access it?” Fay grinned: “She doesn’t, not directly… answers will start appearing in her head, like a gut feeling.” “So she’s going to seem incredibly intelligent?” “Not just seem. She’ll be the most intelligent human ever—by every measure.” “Isn’t Li Mei afraid she’ll take over the world?” Fay: “She would, if we hadn’t crippled her with severe social anxiety and executive dysfunction outside of her scope. Li Mei insisted; outside her focus she loses interest.” Jejune: “That seems sad.” Fay: “It makes sense if you don’t want to watch the world burn.” She noted seconds ticking until scripts finished deploying and added, “Wanna see through Skree’s eyes?” Jejune nodded enthusiastically.",
    "dense_recap_250w": "Inside a full-immersion tri-D, Fay and Jejune appear as ghostly observers in Skree’s simulated workroom. Fay demonstrates that their session is observation-only and invites Jejune to approach Skree, whose appearance matches her eventual real-world body. A background NPC is dismissed as “pure simulation.” Jejune asks about sexuality; Fay explains Skree is infertile because her reproductive organs were surgically replaced with a compact high-performance compute core and its integrated batteries, couplers, insulation, and cooling. The core performs ~10^12 calculations per second at idle and can reach ~10^21 in an extreme mode that requires external power and external cooling to avoid internal overheating. Skree will not consciously “use” the core; instead, solutions surface as intuitive “gut feelings.” Fay asserts Skree will be the most intelligent human ever on every measurable scale. To prevent runaway power, Li Mei required performance-limiting blocks, imposing severe social anxiety and executive dysfunction for anything outside Skree’s narrow scope; thus she focuses on codebreaking and hacking while quickly losing interest elsewhere. As Fay quietly watches time for her malware deployment tick down, she offers Jejune a deeper perspective: to ride “passenger” and see through Skree’s eyes. Jejune, captivated, agrees—positioning herself for further compromise while the simulation continues to mirror Skree’s lived-in reality.",
