    "full_scene_clean": "Citizen ID 291874232 Lucas undergoes successful optic-nerve interface surgery with nerve-collar implants and temporary corneal displays for calibration. Technicians explain that Stella will map the optic pathways over three weeks, after which images can be projected directly to cortex. Lucas’s family—wife Michelle, son Randy, daughter Shelly—visit in recovery. Technician Charlie demonstrates UI: an upgraded tongue mag-dot and reactive ink patterns on palate/teeth, enabling lingual control of a Personal Information Display (PID). Lucas authorizes Charlie’s shadow control and begins Stella’s induction course. They discuss SAIR (Stella Aggregated Identity Ranking), Goldilocks Zone learning, and daily planning around objectives. Randy is eager for surgery; Michelle hesitates and withholds Shelly for now, proposing the girls go later. In a common area, Lucas practices voice and tongue inputs, views his SAIR dashboard, and consents for Randy’s procedure via a message panel. Randy departs with Charlie to begin, while Lucas continues onboarding, feeling both pride and apprehension about their new life under Stella and the Metrofederacy.",
    "dense_recap_250w": "In 2165, Lucas completes Metrofederacy optic-nerve implant surgery: interface collars are placed on the optic nerves and temporary corneal displays installed for calibration. A technician, Charlie, introduces Lucas to Stella’s interface stack—an upgraded tongue ‘mag-dot’ working with reactive ink on palate/teeth to control a Personal Information Display (PID). Lucas accepts Charlie’s shadow request and starts the training module. Stella’s SAIR (Aggregated Identity Ranking) and the ‘Goldilocks Zone’ learning model are explained as the basis for careers, compensation, and daily goals. Michelle is cautious about rapid adoption, agreeing that Randy (12) can proceed now while she and Shelly (7) wait. In the bustling induction common area, Lucas uses voice and lingual gestures to bring up his SAIR, navigates graphs, and signs a digital consent so Randy can enter a surgery surgepod immediately. The scene balances awe at seamless human–AI integration with concerns about surveillance and family pacing of adoption. Lucas feels both excitement and responsibility as he embraces the Metrofederacy’s promise and prepares to guide his family through the transition.",
