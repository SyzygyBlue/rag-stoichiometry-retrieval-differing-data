She orders a kitchen module caf, checks her study pod and scripts still scraping the massive dataset, then decides to switch contexts to certification. Inside the pod, she starts the MD (Metrofederacy Clinical Track) final exam and grinds through it. While her score is pending, an urgent Forensic Investigations Level III request arrives: destination Fox River/Broken Bow Free City, transport in 19 minutes. Believing she has no choice, she accepts, follows a cyan AR guide from her apartment to a podlev and then to Flight Platform 7C. On the way she flags a StellaNet tri-D story about an explosion in a Wildlander city near Broken Bow. Reaching the tarmac, she receives her MD result (PASS, 81.7), then boards a sleek supersonic flier, jaw set against the dread of becoming prey. She whispers a vow to beat Fay and steps aboard.",
    "dense_recap_250w": "Back at her newly cleaned apartment, Shelly runs a quick news filter near Broken Bow, then pivots from data scraping to professional leverage: she launches the Metrofederacy MD (Clinical) final exam in her study pod. Emerging exhausted as scoring processes, she receives an urgent Stella Forensic Investigations Level III tasking for Fox River/Broken Bow Free City with transport departing in 19 minutes. Recognizing the risk—and suspecting this could align with the Bolivia↔Broken Bow lead she and Lucas discussed—she accepts immediately. A cyan guide path routes her to a waiting podlev and onwards to Flight Platform 7C. En route she flags a StellaNet tri-D report of a nearby Wildlander city explosion (within her 250 km filter) to review later. On the wind-swept tarmac by a sleek supersonic flier she sees her exam result: PASS, score 81.7. She carries no bag, choosing speed over preparation, and steels herself against the sense of being baited. Thinking of Randy and Fay’s predation, she whispers a promise—“I’m going to beat you”—and boards the transport for Broken Bow under a classified Forensic Division assignment.",
