    "full_scene_clean": "Davian raises a green OPEN flag to start the caravan’s trade day and warns everyone to stay sharp. A slow-moving mass of skervs, many barefoot and starving, advances from the brush line with packs, sleds, and makeshift litters. Quincy staffs a steel-shrouded vendor table beside Stan and Emory; Lewallen covers them from a scissor-lifted .30 cal while Franklin and Stephan stand guard in mixed armor. Water sells at three holos per liter via a worn chip reader. A brawl erupts in the crowd over a canvas bag; steel flashes, the bag tears, and a crush of bodies strips the ground. Davian refuses to police them but orders deterrent bursts into the dirt if shots start. After the frenzy, a wounded woman clutches a single food tin; a little girl clings to her. A gray-haired man lies still while another woman takes his clothes. Davian and the team infer a recently fallen holdfast from intact gear and supplies; caution is advised. They discuss routing paying refugees toward Broken Bow or nearby holdfasts if possible, though entry is scarce without skills or holos. As the crowd closes to a hundred meters, Quincy steels herself for a day of desperation and refusals, noticing a thin boy who seems ready to try something.",
    "dense_recap_250w": "Davian, leader of the Three Shovels and husband to Mama Valorie, hoists the green OPEN flag, launching a precarious trade day on a fortified hill. Skervs—ragged survivors from the wildlands—shuffle in from the brush line with sleds, litters, and salvaged packs. Quincy works a bullet-scarred vendor table with a sliding window; Stan mans tools and a holocred chip reader, while Emory grumbles through his shift. Overwatch comes from Lewallen on a scissor-lifted .30 cal; Franklin and Stephan stand ready with rifles and face shields. Clean water costs three holos per liter; filters are still good, but resupply looms. In the crowd, a fight over a canvas bag explodes—steel flashes, the bag tears, and massed bodies strip the spill. Davian won’t act as police, but authorizes warning bursts into the dirt if gunfire starts. Afterward, a bleeding woman secures a single food tin; a child clings to her. A nearby gray-haired man lies motionless as another scavenges his clothes. Reading the signs—unspent supplies, intact carts—Davian suspects a holdfast recently fell, implying someone is conquering settlements. The crew weighs options for those with holos to buy passage toward Broken Bow or for acceptance at a holdfast, though odds are poor without hard skills. As the crowd closes to within a hundred meters, Quincy braces for transactions soaked in desperation, clocking a gaunt boy who seems intent on a move.",
