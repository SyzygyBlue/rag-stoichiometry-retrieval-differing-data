    "full_scene_clean": "A soft knock startles Evelyn. She crosses her dorm, steadying her blouse with her good hand while the other is trapped in a rigid cast. Fear spikes—last time it was robed men—but she opens the door a crack and exhales: it’s Demmy, holding a single dandelion and wearing black cargo pants, knit shirt, and a nylon vest. They sit at the bed’s edge. He says he’s training with the TRiGgers’ spec-ops but is still an initiate in the Order. He asks about her hand; the doctor set the bones, no permanent damage. When she asks how he stays himself after so much pain, he says, \"Nostalgia is for people with happy memories.\" Emotion breaks through; she climbs into his lap and sobs while he holds and rubs her back in silence. When she whispers she’s ugly, he lifts her and sways; at her request he carries her to the hallway outside the women’s lavatory, waits, and then she wipes his neck dry. The dandelion is bent and broken; they place it in water. She calls it the most beautiful thing; he replies, \"Second. And it’s not close.\" She kisses him. She asks him to hold her a while so the world can edge back toward normal. He sits; she curls into his lap, and they stay there, wrapped together.",
    "dense_recap_250w": "On December 1, 2186, Evelyn—still recovering from torture with a broken left hand in a cast—answers a tentative knock in her dorm, bracing for danger. It’s Demmy, not robed captors, carrying a single dandelion. He’s out of robes and in black TRG spec-ops training clothes; he clarifies he is training with the ‘TRiGgers’ while remaining an initiate of the Order. They sit at the edge of her bed. He checks on her hand; the doctor expects no permanent damage. When she asks how he remains himself after so much suffering, Demmy answers that ‘nostalgia is for people with happy memories.’ Overwhelmed, Evelyn climbs into his lap and sobs while he holds her silently, then carries her to the hallway outside the women’s lavatory at her request and waits. Back in the room, they place the battered dandelion in a small vase; she calls it the most beautiful thing, and he gently corrects her—\"Second. And it’s not close\"—affirming her worth over the flower. She kisses him and asks him to just hold her so the world can drift a bit closer to normal. The scene cements mutual trust, tenderness, and non-sexual physical comfort after trauma, while also noting Demmy’s ongoing TRG training and his continued affiliation with the Order.",
