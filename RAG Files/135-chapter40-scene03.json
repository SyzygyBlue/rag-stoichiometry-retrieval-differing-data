    "full_scene_clean": "Jeb McTanner waited in Chancellor Margdelain's office while she finished a call, looking unusually pleased. She set out two crystal whiskey glasses and poured her finest bottle—an obvious tell to McTanner that a bad ask was coming. He folded his arms and told her to get on with it. Margdelain admitted she didn’t relish it either, then framed the geopolitical backdrop: Fox River and Ransom Canyon were close to open hostility. She brought up the Calum-Tam Holdfast, a day and a half away by vehicle, noting its friendly ties with Ransom Canyon. Teasing the reveal, she asked Jeb to guess who was there. He first guessed Jessop. Margdelain said Jessop was in Ransom Canyon, likely with Makko and his ravagers. The realization hit Jeb; he asked if it was Chase. Margdelain confirmed. McTanner took a fortifying sip of whiskey.",
    "dense_recap_250w": "In Margdelain’s office, Jeb McTanner senses trouble when the Chancellor, uncharacteristically warm and celebratory, sets out expensive whiskey before discussing regional tensions. She reviews Fox River’s near-hostility with Ransom Canyon and then pivots to the nearby Calum-Tam Holdfast, which maintains good relations with Ransom. Building to a reveal, Margdelain prompts Jeb to guess who is currently at Calum-Tam. He hazards Jessop, but she corrects him—Jessop is believed to be in Ransom Canyon with Makko’s zealot ravagers. Jeb realizes the implication and names Chase. Margdelain confirms that Chase is at Calum-Tam. The whiskey functions as both social lubricant and signal that she is about to assign Jeb a difficult, distasteful task likely involving a delicate approach to a holdfast friendly with Fox River’s hostile neighbor. The scene closes with Jeb bracing himself, drink in hand, for whatever Margdelain will ask him to do next.",
