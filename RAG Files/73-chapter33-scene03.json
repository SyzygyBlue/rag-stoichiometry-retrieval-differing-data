    "full_scene_clean": "The blast flips the TEG-4 end-over-end; it lands right side up in grass off the gravel road. Seatbelts hold; Chase stays conscious and sees a tire roll away. Electrical smoke fills the cab. Quincy’s head lolls but she’s breathing. Several men run toward them. With seconds to act, Chase pulls the implant holocred injector his mother gave him, caps it, presses it to Quincy’s shoulder, and fires. He tosses the spent injector behind and goes limp, eyes slitted. Quincy jolts awake, curses, draws her .45 to dangle between her legs. Chase: “Holos. Lots of them. Had to stash them somewhere.” He slowly frees the .380 on his thigh and hides it between his knees. Quincy approves and instructs: “Two rounds, mid-chest. Don’t hesitate, just shoot.” Shouts grow nearer. Quincy's door is yanked open.",
    "dense_recap_250w": "An IED catapults the Fox River TEG-4, which lands upright in the roadside grass with smoke in the cab and a tire rolling away. Chase remains conscious and confirms Quincy is breathing as armed men close in. With only moments, he prioritizes both survival and asset security: he produces the implantable holocred injector his mother prepared and injects the funds into Quincy’s shoulder, getting the money off his person before capture or a search. He discards the injector and feigns semi-consciousness. Quincy snaps awake, furious at the unexpected injection, but immediately shifts to combat mode, drawing her .45. Chase quietly brings his concealed .380 into position between his knees. Quincy gives terse, lethal guidance—“Two rounds, mid-chest. Don’t hesitate, just shoot.”—setting their immediate rules of engagement. The attackers’ shouts reach the vehicle and someone rips open Quincy’s door, ending the scene on the brink of a close-quarters firefight. The passage underscores the duo’s emergent battlefield cohesion despite prior mistrust: Chase acts decisively and tactically (asset concealment, deception, arming), while Quincy sets doctrine and readies to kill. It advances stakes on multiple fronts—physical survival, the political/financial thread tied to Margdelain’s holocreds, and the question of who orchestrated the ambush—while preserving the gritty, high-intensity tone.",
