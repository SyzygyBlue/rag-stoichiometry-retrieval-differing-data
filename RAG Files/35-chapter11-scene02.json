    "full_scene_clean": "Chancellor Margdelain’s whipcrack \"Come\" summons Chase into the cold, book-scented, cramped original Fox River executive office. She fixes him with a long, unreadable stare; he reads the telltale tension anyway. Margdelain reminds him she spent months convincing Diplomat Emeritus Bartholemew to take him as apprentice—and that he turned it down. Chase holds ground: he doesn’t want diplomacy or politics; he wants to enlist in TRG and train under Master McTanner. She warns he’s throwing away a legacy and shifts to personal barbs, even invoking his dead birth mother. He frames it not as rebellion but choice. Calculating now, she notes what he’s walking away from. He answers that if it’s truly his legacy, it will still be there later. She predicts regret. He replies he’ll manage and leaves her to decide whether she built him or failed to stop him. Her final move: it won’t be easy for him—or McTanner—because McTanner works for her. A curt gesture dismisses him. Stomach twisting, face neutral, Chase exits.",
    "dense_recap_250w": "Chase is summoned into Chancellor Margdelain’s austere, tradition-signaling office. She immediately presses him about refusing a prestigious apprenticeship with Diplomat Emeritus Bartholemew, which she spent months arranging. He offers no long explanation, only a firm declaration: he doesn’t want to be a diplomat or politician and intends to enlist in the TRG to train under Master McTanner. Margdelain’s response shifts from pressure to personal jabs, even invoking his deceased birth mother. Chase keeps his composure, reframes his refusal as agency rather than rebellion, and argues that if the path she built is truly his legacy, it will remain available later. Margdelain warns that he was raised to lead, not take orders, and that the TRG will chew him up. He counters that he’ll manage and challenges her to decide whether she built him or merely failed to stop him. In a final reveal and power play, Margdelain says it won’t be easy for him or for McTanner—because McTanner works for her—then dismisses Chase. He leaves outwardly calm but inwardly twisted, understanding she already set constraints around his chosen path.",
