    "full_scene_clean": "Lenya forces open a vast, decaying agriculture warehouse where food and old machines sit in disrepair: hydroponics vats, a monorail bucket line, fridges, and sorters. Quincy and Chase survey the space; Lenya says few can maintain it. Lesha, a hard-edged technician on a rolling stool, emerges and insults the visitors. Quincy notices hex-patterned skin and a neck cable. Lesha explains she was an ex-megacorp merc with full-body Dermoweave and a now-disabled neuroject; without its chems she suffers severe withdrawal. She injects Sykotiq with a chemjector, noting she works here for stims, food, and a bed, with no pay and no exit. Quincy condemns the holdfast for enslaving and cooking stims; Lenya fires back that caravanners let thousands die while hauling supplies. As the drug takes hold, Lesha watches them with weary detachment.",
    "dense_recap_250w": "Lenya brings Quincy (POV) and Chase into a cavernous, dilapidated agriculture warehouse at the Calum-Tam holdfast: dead or dying hydroponics vats, a monorail bucket line, sorters, and old refrigerators. Maintenance has lapsed for years, and only Lesha tends to the equipment. Lesha arrives on a mechanic’s stool and immediately needles the group. Quincy spots a hex pattern on Lesha’s skin and a cable at her neck; Lesha demonstrates and explains her history: a former megacorp mercenary fitted with all-over Dermoweave and a neuroject that once balanced her biochemistry between combat stims and burnout. When she aged out, software keys were revoked, the pumps were disabled, and withdrawal set in. She now relies on injected Sykotiq to function. Desperate, she accepted a ‘devil’s bargain’ with the holdfast: stims, food, and a place to sleep in exchange for keeping their autopacker and related systems alive—no wages and effectively no freedom to leave. Quincy condemns Calum-Tam for enslaving people and manufacturing bathtub stims; Lenya counters that caravans routinely let the desperate die while transporting abundance. As Sykotiq hits, Lesha relaxes and watches, underscoring the moral rot and mutual hypocrisy surrounding survival, power, and dependency.",
