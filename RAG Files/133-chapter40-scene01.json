    "full_scene_clean": "The volume of evidence from the tunnels beneath Fox River—the “downbelow”—is staggering. Reports show Jessop funneled holocreds to Ransom Canyon and coordinated with Calum-Tam Holdfast, building a militant arm for his church while denouncing Stella as a false god. The hypocrisy is galling: the Metrofederacy’s money indirectly funded zealots who despise it. Jessop escaped through a crude, clawed-out tunnel when Demmy’s attack began. Demmy killed about ten people in minutes with scissors and letter openers; instead of prison, he’s slated for commendation. The council met: Jessop is expelled, allies suspended, and Margdelain’s proposal to formally explore Metrofederacy membership passed easily. Councilman Bivualier’s remains were found in a lye-filled bag behind a wall panel—identified by dental records; motive uncertain. Margdelain sips whiskey, musing that Demmy accomplished in an hour what she’d pursued for a decade, while lamenting that her son Chase chose the wildlands over contributing. She resolves not to give up on him and even jokes about adoption papers for Demmy.",
    "dense_recap_250w": "Margdelain reviews the flood of evidence seized from Fox River’s newly revealed subterranean “downbelow.” Dossiers detail Brother Jessop’s clandestine financing of Ransom Canyon and links to Calum-Tam Holdfast, apparently nurturing a paramilitary wing for his church even as he railed against Stella as a murderous false god. Margdelain notes the irony that Metrofederacy holocreds appear to have underwritten a movement bent on opposing it. Jessop himself escaped via a narrow, clawed tunnel during the TRG action precipitated by Demmy’s violent incursion. She marvels that Demmy, armed only with a broken pair of cloth scissors and several letter openers, slew roughly ten people within minutes; rather than being jailed, he is poised to receive a commendation because his actions exposed systemic crimes. Politically, the fallout is immediate: a Fox River council session expels Jessop, suspends close allies pending investigation, and passes Margdelain’s motion to formally explore Metrofederacy membership. Additional shocks include the discovery of Councilman Bivualier’s corpse concealed in a chemically resistant, lye-filled bag; dental records confirm identity while motive remains unclear. Between sips of whiskey, Margdelain frames the moment as the culmination of a decade of maneuvering, ruefully observes her son Chase’s absence and misaligned priorities, and quips about drafting adoption papers for Demmy—the “murder goblin” whose actions accidentally delivered her the leverage to remake Fox River.",
