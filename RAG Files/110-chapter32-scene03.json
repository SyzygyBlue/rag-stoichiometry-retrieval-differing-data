    "full_scene_clean": "About an hour and a half later, Evelyn returned to her dormitory, determination humming beneath her calm exterior. She had finished setting up her handheld for basic use — personalization could wait. Right now, she had a connection to make, a promise to keep. She created a new contact. Fingers lingered as she typed his name: Demmy. Her heart skipped a beat as she started typing the message.\n\nHey Demmy, it's Evelyn. I picked up a new handheld, and I just wanted you to know what a fantastic time I had. I can't wait to see you again. I'd go exploring with you anywhere. You should know, because of you, I haven't been able to stop smiling.\n\nEvelyn had erased and rewritten that simple message more than a dozen times. She set her handheld down, not expecting an immediate reply. But her heart hammered in her chest; she needed something to do while she waited. She dug around in her backpack and pulled out the beaten-up old datapad she had taken from Demmy. Smiling, she wiped the display with her hand. She keyed the power button. It thrilled her to think what secrets the device might hold, but it was old and taking a while to boot up. She grabbed her handheld, checking it even though she knew no messages were waiting. An idea popped into her head: she went to device controls and enabled location tracking, choosing Demmy's contact... he'd be able to know where she was now. Then, she began writing another message.\n\nHey Demmy, I hope you are thinking about me. I turned on location tracking so you can always see where I am. I thought it would be kinda cool...\n\nShe erased the message. Too creepy. She was about to turn location tracking back off — then the datapad began to beep — rapid, insistent. Setting down her handheld, she picked up the ravager device. The beeping was messages coming in — lots of them. She could read some of them as they scrolled across the screen. They said terrible things. Her eyes went wide. She knew some of those names. Some of the messages were from people she knew in the Order. Oh God! We're involved with the ravagers?!",
    "dense_recap_250w": "Evelyn returns to her dorm after obtaining a new handheld and sets it up for basic use. Intent on keeping a promise to connect, she creates a new contact for Demmy and drafts a warm message, revising it repeatedly. While waiting for any reply, she pulls out a battered datapad she previously took from Demmy and powers it on, curious about what it might contain. On her handheld, a sudden idea leads her to enable location tracking and link it to Demmy’s contact so he can see where she is; she starts drafting a second note to explain, then deletes it as too forward. As she considers turning tracking back off, the old datapad beeps rapidly: a flood of incoming messages appears. Skimming the scrolling text, she is shocked by their content and by the names attached—some belong to people she recognizes from within the Order. Confronted with this unexpected linkage, she recoils at the implication that the Order may have communications with ravagers. The scene ends on her alarmed realization, with location tracking recently enabled and the datapad actively receiving disturbing messages.",
