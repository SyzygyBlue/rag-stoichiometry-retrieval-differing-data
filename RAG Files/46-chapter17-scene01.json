    "full_scene_clean": "Chancellor Margdelain reviews a Master Scrivener report flagging Councilman Bivualier: three times he moved 1–5 million holos from a departmental account to an anonymous account, later replaced from an official but unnamed account. Using tired Wildlander corneal tech and a tongue microdot to scroll, she weighs launching an investigation versus securing votes to open an inquiry on joining the Metrofederacy. She decides she needs Bivualier’s vote more than a probe, calls him, and he caves. With his support, she now has the majority to post a straight up-or-down vote for that afternoon. As Master Scrivener Francis amends and posts the docket, McTanner calls; Margdelain unleashes a profanity-laced tirade over Chase jeopardizing her work but does not fire McTanner.",
    "dense_recap_250w": "In her office on the morning of Oct 13, Chancellor Margdelain analyzes a financial anomaly flagged by Master Scrivener Francis: Councilman Bivualier made three transfers of 1–5 million holos from a departmental account into an unregistered, anonymous account, each later backfilled from a third official but unnamed account. While the final balances look normal, the pattern suggests Bivualier is brokering dubious transactions on behalf of an entity that cares about secrecy. Margdelain is tempted to investigate the source of the replenishing official funds but prioritizes a critical political objective—securing an afternoon vote to open an inquiry into joining the Metrofederacy. With the chamber at 24 members plus the chancellor, recent trial votes were 13 against and 12 for (including her), so flipping one ‘no’ is decisive. She calls Bivualier and secures his support, giving her the majority needed to docket a straight up-or-down vote. After Francis amends and posts the docket, Margdelain’s personal line rings: McTanner. She doesn’t fire him, but she erupts, furious that her son’s actions in the field could jeopardize the political push. The scene frames Margdelain’s realpolitik—shelving a corruption probe to win a larger strategic fight—and reveals the strain between her governance agenda and McTanner/Chase’s operations.",
