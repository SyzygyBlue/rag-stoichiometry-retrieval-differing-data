    "full_scene_clean": "Chase enters Chancellor Margdelain’s office, fury contained behind a stone mask. He refuses small talk and asks directly why she planted false evidence on the Three Shovels caravan. Margdelain momentarily freezes—Chase realizes she didn’t know. He recounts: Quincy caught a man snooping at the trucks, broke his nose; the intruder escaped in a TRG buggy. Later, Chase and Quincy found a staged, partially damaged note implying ravagers took the caravan to Ransom Canyon’s slave markets. Margdelain reveals Quincy has been put in the stockade after a bar fight with a TRG man likely baiting her—the photos show preexisting facial injuries. They deduce someone set a trap to frame Margdelain: the planted note would be tied to her for political damage. Calmly, Margdelain decides to remove pieces from the board: she loads 100,000 holocreds onto an implantable chip as overpayment for the trucks, orders Chase to take a fully provisioned cart and his preferred rifle, extract Quincy, and head to Broken Bow. Master Scrivener Francis reports two clergy are demanding to see her; she asserts control and delays them ten minutes. Margdelain instructs Chase to leave soon and stay out of Fox River until she resolves the plot. Chase departs, stops by the medical ward, and leaves Demmy a note hidden under a beat-up datapad and a cracked camera before setting his own plan in motion.",
    "dense_recap_250w": "In Margdelain’s office, Chase confronts his mother about a planted note found under a Three Shovels truck that blames ravagers and points to Ransom Canyon. Margdelain’s brief tell convinces him she wasn’t behind it. He explains Quincy fought a flashlight-wielding intruder the prior night and the man fled in a TRG buggy. Margdelain shows a report: Quincy later brawled with a TRG man at a bar and was jailed for 24 hours; his facial injuries predate the fight, suggesting intentional bait to get her detained. Together they infer a political trap aimed at Margdelain—plant evidence others can discover and tie to her. Declaring they must get vulnerable “pieces off the board,” Margdelain loads 100,000 holocreds onto an implantable chip as payment for the trucks and orders Chase to take a fully provisioned cart—stocked by Master McTanner/Jeb with Chase’s favored rifle—extract Quincy, and go to Broken Bow, keeping away from Fox River while she manages the crisis and likely loses an imminent council vote. Master Scrivener Francis warns two clergy are pressing to see her; Margdelain imposes protocol and delays them. Chase leaves, intends to help Quincy, and stops at the medical ward to leave Demmy a hidden note beneath a worn datapad and a cracked camera, hoping to enlist the recovering “skerv” kid for a low-odds plan.",
