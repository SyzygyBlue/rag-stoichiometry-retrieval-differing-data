    "full_scene_clean": "Demmy moved at a quiet sprint through Fox River’s service corridors, following the same path he and Evelyn had taken the night before. “I’m coming, hold on,” he whispered, checking the app periodically and marking his progress toward the dot. He didn’t yet know how he would reach the unmapped areas; the entrance would be hidden. He’d deal with that when he found it.\nA metallic glint caught his eye: the broken-bladed scissors they’d seen last night. He picked them up, threading fingers through the large handle and his thumb through the other. The single forearm-length blade still shone in the penlight’s beam.\n“Welcome back to the world of usefulness,” he said, flexing the blade to test it. Once cloth shears, now something else entirely: a weapon.\n“We were both repurposed today,” he whispered, lips set, eyes flint-hard. He pressed onward, closing the distance to the beaconed dot on his screen.",
    "dense_recap_250w": "Demmy advances through Fox River’s dark service corridors, retracing the route he and Evelyn used the previous night. He speaks a promise—“I’m coming, hold on”—and repeatedly checks a mapping app that shows a beaconed dot representing Evelyn’s location. The displayed path is essentially a beeline, but he remains uncertain how to descend into the unmapped levels the signal indicates; he assumes any access point will be concealed and resolves to face that challenge when he reaches it. Along the way he spots a familiar object: a heavy pair of scissors with one blade broken off that he and Evelyn encountered earlier. Demmy retrieves the tool, threads his fingers through the handles, tests the remaining forearm-length blade under his penlight, and deliberately reframes it from discarded craft shears into a weapon suitable for close-quarters use. He quietly observes that both he and the blade have been “repurposed” by events. The scene locks in several actionable elements for retrieval and downstream logic: Demmy’s stealthy pursuit via corridors, his ongoing reliance on the device’s location-tracking progress markers, the presence of unmapped subterranean regions beneath Fox River requiring a hidden entry, and the acquisition of an improvised blade that formalizes his transition from seeker to imminent combatant. He continues toward the signal, intent on reaching Evelyn and whatever lies beyond the mapped infrastructure.",
