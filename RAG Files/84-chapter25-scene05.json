    "full_scene_clean": "“Where is Carl!” Lenya shouted, rage clearing the courtyard as laborers and guards scrambled. Carl arrived eating a sandwich. Lenya pointed at the battered Chase: “What happened to him?” Carl shrugged. In one fluid motion she drew, cocked, and jammed her pistol under his chin. “Lie to me again.” Sweat beaded on Carl’s brow. He said Chase had disobeyed his orders. Lenya pressed: what orders could he disobey in a locked cell? Then the core question: did he hear her tell him to leave Chase alone, and that the two were not to be harmed? Carl nodded. She forced him to state the place—Calum-Tam Holdfast—and her name—Lenya Tam—then holstered the pistol with a threat: if either prisoner is harmed, Carl will live in a cell and dig in the fields forever. She ordered staff to clean Chase up and move both prisoners to Production & Operations to help Lesha fix an autopacker, noting they likely should have been housed there with bunks from the start. As they were pulled from the line, Quincy gave Chase a tiny, private acknowledgment; he returned a micro-gesture. Walking away, Quincy drifted closer to him. Chase felt their dynamic shift slightly for the better—even as Carl’s departing glare promised deadly enmity.",
    "dense_recap_250w": "Lenya erupts into the Calum–Tam courtyard demanding Carl, the brutal overseer. When he appears eating a sandwich, she zeros in on Chase’s visible injuries and asks what happened. After Carl’s evasions, Lenya draws and cocks her sidearm in a blink, shoving the barrel under his chin before witnesses. She boxes him in with questions he can’t dodge: Chase was in a locked cell; had Carl heard her order to leave the two ‘important guests’ alone and unharmed? Carl wordlessly acknowledges. Lenya forces a public reaffirmation of authority—the place name and her full name—then threatens him with permanent demotion to prisoner labor if either Quincy or Chase is harmed. She immediately repositions the pair: they are to be cleaned up and taken to Production & Operations to assist Lesha with an autopacker fault, with bunks available there—an implicit upgrade in status and mobility. As guards escort them out, Quincy grants Chase a fleeting head-tilt and stays a step nearer, signaling begrudging respect. Chase reads the confrontation as a strategic win but also recognizes he has made a dangerous enemy in Carl. The scene resets the power dynamic: Lenya asserts control and protection, Carl is publicly checked, and Quincy and Chase gain access to a technical workspace that may present new leverage or escape opportunities.",
