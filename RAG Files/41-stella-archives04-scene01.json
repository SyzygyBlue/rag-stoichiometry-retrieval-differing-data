    "full_scene_clean": "Randy and his girlfriend, Fay, stand in a holotainment center’s 3×3 m room, immersed in a tri-D world they built: riding a balloon through a gas giant’s upper atmosphere. Mist beads on their faces while megafauna with hydrogen bladders drift by. They focus on an olefin—long bladder, manta-like wings. Fay suggests a crenulated crest; she re-instantiates the model and edits while Randy adjusts coloring. The live scene morphs; they kiss. Fay’s passion is physics-realistic VR; Randy loves joining her and recalls her underwater holotank world that now requires scarce bookings. He’s just earned a second master’s (EE) after mechanics and started SAIR progress for a Ph.D., eager for independence. Fay, three months older, already holds a Ph.D. in neuroinformatics, specializing in corpus callosum mapping. She invites him to a couple’s pod; Stella, the civic system, has told her to spend more frivolous recreation time. They change clothes; Stella applies AR styling (his blue stripe; her yellow-green tea flowers). Opting to jog twelve blocks, they check exercise bars. As they run, Randy asks about her research; she steers him to his neuroject menu—the one she unlocked—and tells him to bump Q13 by 3%. He accepts the warning about SAIR impact and doses. A cocktail of dopamine, norepinephrine, oxytocin floods him; desire surges. Fay jokes and slaves his optics to her feed while she jogs backward; she teases, promising the pod is close. He asks if it’s safe; she says never go over three. They reach the automated facility, preregistered. Kissing in the elevator, they stumble into the assigned pod as the door whispers shut and noise cancellation clicks on.",
    "dense_recap_250w": "In 2170 within the Stella Metrofederacy, Randy (19), an ambitious dual-master’s engineering student working toward SAIR requirements, and his equally young but further-advanced girlfriend Fay (Ph.D. neuroinformatics, corpus callosum specialist) co-create in a holotainment suite: a physics-rigorous gas-giant balloon world featuring an ‘olefin’ creature they modify in real time. Fay, mandated by Stella’s recreation policy, invites Randy to a couple’s pod twelve blocks away. After changing into AR-styled outfits, they jog, monitoring personal exercise bars. Fay directs Randy to his implanted neuroject interface she previously unlocked and has him increase Q13 by 3%, a blend including dopamine, norepinephrine, and oxytocin, despite a caution that overuse may affect his SAIR. The dose heightens arousal and bonding; Fay playfully slaves Randy’s optics to her view as she jogs backward, guiding him while teasing. He asks about safety; she warns never to exceed three. They arrive at a fully automated pod facility (pre-booked, no attendant), ride the elevator while kissing, and enter as noise cancellation engages. The scene establishes their techno-romance, Fay’s cutting-edge brain research, Stella’s pervasive governance (AR clothing, quotas, SAIR), and normalized neurochemical self-modulation in leisure and intimacy.",
