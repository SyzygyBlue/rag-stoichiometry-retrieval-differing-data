    "full_scene_clean": "Two hours later, the two-seater's power dipped—time for a battery swap. Quincy steered into a shallow depression cloaked in tall grass, a perfect spot to do the exchange and stretch their cramped legs. The air hung heavy, thick with the scent of parched earth and the faint, acrid smell of hot resin from the overworked electric motor. A gust of wind whipped through the tall grass, causing the tasseled tops of the dry, yellow weeds to ripple in waves.\n\"My ass is numb,\" Quincy grumbled, jumping out and arching her back with a satisfying groan.\n\"Feels like I've taken a beating,\" Demmy agreed, unfolding his stiff limbs from the cart.\nQuincy walked past, tracing a grimy finger along one of the cart's welds, then headed deeper into the grass. \"She's holding up well. Wish my bones felt the same,\" she mumbled, flexing her stiff shoulders.\nA few meters into the grass, Quincy found a good spot and squatted. A line of ants, segmented bodies gleaming a menacing red, marched in a line near the toes of her boots. Ignoring the prickly stalks poking her, she finished, pulled up her pants, and tied the cinch.\n\"Ground's swarming with these big red fuckers,\" Demmy warned, swatting at a cloud of gnats.\n\"Red ants,\" Quincy confirmed.\n\"Don't let them on you.\"\n\"Hell no. Let's get the batteries changed and scoot.\"\n\"I hate bugs,\" Demmy muttered. \"Been bitten... way too many times.\"\n\"I slept in tents my whole life,\" Quincy said, rummaging through her toolbox.\nDemmy's jaw clenched. \"No, you don't. There's no way you can truly get it. Quincy, your worst day was better than my best. We're not the same.\"\nAwkward seconds ticked by. Demmy looked to the horizon. \"You want to catch up to your caravan, I get that. But when we get there... what happens to me? Who's in charge of Three Shovels?\"\n\"The old man, Davian and his wife, Valorie.\"\n\"Will they let me join?\"\n\"Yeah, I'm pretty sure. They’ll take you in.\"\n\"But you're not certain.\"\n\"I'm not going to speak for Davian. We just lost a lot of good caravanners and will need able bodies. It's a safe assumption.\"\n\"Know what happens if they turn me away? I'm just a dirty skerv, maggot meat.\"\n\"That's not right! We've trusted each other… I have no intention of leaving you behind. And as a caravanner, my word means something.\"\n\"If caravanners are so trustworthy, explain Gavin.\"\nQuincy flinched. \"I'm not like him. When I see him next time, I'm going to kill him. But I swear, you can trust me. On my life, you can.\"\nThey stare each other down. Quincy asks why he hasn’t robbed her. Demmy admits he stayed to learn because she could make ravager carts work; now it feels real and he’s starting to believe. \"People like me can't afford friends… But I'm starting to feel like we could be friends.\"\n\"You're no skerv to me. You're a friend. If we make it to the caravan, they either take us both or neither of us. If they turn us away, we'll leave together and figure it out. That's a promise.\"\nDemmy frowns. \"My gut still warns me…\"\n\"If you come with me and give me your trust, you have an excellent chance. If you walk away, you have no chance at all. It's simple math. Pick one.\"\nHe nods. A fragile understanding settles. \"Sounds suspiciously like hope,\" Demmy mutters. \"Hope's a bitch when it's all you got.\"\n\"You've got more than hope. You have a friend.\"\nThey clasp hands. Quincy feels fear, then resolve: she will keep her promise. She thinks of Robyn and Davian, then kneels to finish the swap. Once the batteries are secured, they climb back in. Quincy floors the throttle toward the shimmering horizon.",
    "dense_recap_250w": "Quincy and Demmy halt their ravager two-seater in a grassland depression to swap depleted batteries. Heat, wind, and the acrid smell of hot resin underscore fatigue as red ants and gnats crawl and swirl. The pause triggers a hard conversation: Demmy challenges Quincy’s ability to understand his life of deprivation and asks what happens to him if Three Shovels refuses him. Quincy cites Davian and Mama Valorie as leaders and says she’s “pretty sure” they’ll accept him after recent losses, but won’t guarantee it. Demmy, calling himself a “dirty skerv,” presses the risk; he also cites Gavin as proof caravanners can’t always be trusted. Quincy rejects the comparison, vows to kill Gavin when she sees him, and swears that Demmy can trust her. She offers a binding promise: if the caravan won’t take Demmy, she’ll leave with him and they’ll survive together. Demmy admits he first stayed to learn from her mechanical skill, but now he’s starting to believe—and to risk friendship. They seal a tentative pact with a handshake. Quincy, shaken by how far she’s committed and mindful of Robyn, finishes the battery change, and the pair drive on, recommitted to catching the caravan with Demmy’s future now tied to hers.",
