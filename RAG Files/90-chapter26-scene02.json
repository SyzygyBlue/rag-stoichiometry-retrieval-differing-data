    "full_scene_clean": "Brother Ernesto and Brother Olafsen escorted Demmy to an old wooden door marked as Initiate Hall. Elder Florian, an older instructor in gray robes with a blue stole bearing the Order’s flaming sword and a bird/book emblem, greeted him kindly. Demmy sat beside a dark-haired initiate, Evelyn, who shared her workbook. The room smelled of candles, old books, and chalk dust. Elder Florian taught that uncovering hidden truth rests on three pillars: sacred texts, the righteous question, and the humble prayer. He directed the class to read and discuss passages, encouraging interpretation and critical thought. The idea of a way to discern truth jolted Demmy, who silently connected it to the life-or-death choices of his past and to Chase’s note. After class, Elder Florian spoke privately with Demmy, acknowledging his years alone in the wildlands and measuring him with evident concern. Demmy admitted fear of being cast out and a desire to belong. Florian assured him he was home and valuable—an expert on the wildlands for the Order’s long-term mission to help those outside the walls. He handed Demmy a reading list (e.g., The Greater Good; The Trials of St. Calynsis; A Journey of Faith) and counseled patience: faith comes as it comes. Demmy agreed to read and learn. Elder Florian asked Evelyn to help Demmy find the Library and show him around, including recreation areas. Evelyn, blushing slightly, led Demmy out to begin.",
    "dense_recap_250w": "Demmy attends his first class in the Divine Order’s Initiate Hall, introduced by Brothers Ernesto and Olafsen to Elder Florian, a kindly, exacting instructor. Seated beside Evelyn, who shares her workbook, Demmy hears Florian outline the Order’s method for uncovering truth: sacred texts, the righteous question, and the humble prayer. The instructional tone is reflective and dialogic, with students invited to interpret scripture. The notion of a reliable path to truth strikes Demmy hard, stirring memories of survival choices in the wildlands and the unresolved implications of Chase’s note. After class, Florian privately acknowledges Demmy’s traumatic past and the improbability of his survival, then reassures him that he belongs at Fox River and is already valuable as an expert on the wildlands—knowledge the Order intends to use for gradual, peaceful improvement beyond the city. Demmy, anxious about being expelled if he lacks utility, admits he wants to belong and to ‘become a good person.’ Florian gives him a substantial reading list (including The Greater Good, The Trials of St. Calynsis, and A Journey of Faith), urging patience and study as foundational work. Evelyn is tasked with guiding Demmy to the Library and showing him monastery spaces. Demmy accepts the assignment, committing to read and learn while his curiosity and need for security deepen.",
