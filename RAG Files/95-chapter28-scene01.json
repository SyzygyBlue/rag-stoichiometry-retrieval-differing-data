    "full_scene_clean": "A key grated; the door opened and Lenya slipped in alone. Quincy leaned against the wall, arms crossed, while Chase rose from his cot, smoothing his red hair and masking pain with a smile. Lenya noted he looked better. Quincy asked, flatly, if they could leave. Lenya said no: dogs, hunters, and traps would stop them—and Carl would make any future attempts hurt. When Chase asked if they were slaves, Lenya denied it, claiming their “sentence” was bought and they’d work at a wage minus room and board until free. Chase offered to buy out the contract on the spot and mocked their failure to vet who they’d seized, calling the court story a lie. Lenya’s confidence slipped; she admitted Quincy was the only intended captive—someone paid a sizable sum to have capable people deliver her. Chase wasn’t part of the bargain. Lenya hinted maybe Chase could leave, but he refused to go without Quincy. \nAn older Asian man entered—Dinh Tam, Lenya’s father and holdfast leader. Chase addressed him as Elder Tam; Dinh asked to be called Dinh. Dinh apologized for a “misunderstanding” and called them guests who could not leave, citing delicate, dangerous obligations jeopardized by their presence. Quincy rejected the euphemism; if they couldn’t leave, they were prisoners, and she wasn’t “picking out curtains.” Dinh ordered they be extended every courtesy—within reason—and said he would work to release them, find them work if needed, but didn’t care if they did it. Chase stated he wouldn’t leave without Quincy. Dinh threatened that “dead and missing works the same,” prioritizing the holdfast’s obligations. When Quincy argued release would solve things, Dinh named Chase’s mother—Chancellor Margdelain of Fox River—and revealed he had already verified Chase on the Macrobus. He warned there were larger forces at play than Chase realized. Quincy defied him, insisting she had to reach Broken Bow to find her family. Dinh replied he could stop her and forced a choice: relative luxury here, a slave cell, or a hole in the ground—she would be staying regardless. He added he only cared about Margdelain’s boy and told Lenya she could do what she wanted with Quincy. Dinh left. Quincy, shaken but resolute, repeated she had to get back on the road. Lenya’s attention stayed fixed on Chase.",
    "dense_recap_250w": "Lenya enters Quincy and Chase’s new quarters at the Calum-Tam Holdfast and denies their request to leave, warning that dogs, hunters, traps—and Carl—will stop escape attempts. She frames their status as paid “sentences” with wages offset by living costs. Chase calls out the lie and offers to buy out their contract immediately, pressing Lenya to reveal what’s really happening. Under pressure, Lenya admits Quincy was the only intended target: someone paid a large sum to have her captured and delivered to Calum-Tam; Chase was not part of the bargain. Chase refuses Lenya’s implied option to release him without Quincy. Dinh Tam arrives, apologizes for the “misunderstanding,” and declares them “guests” who cannot leave due to dangerous, delicate obligations. He orders that they be given every courtesy but underscores the threat: if Chase makes trouble, “dead and missing works the same.” When Quincy argues for release, Dinh identifies Chase as the son of Chancellor Margdelain and says he verified this on the Macrobus. He warns that powerful forces are moving beyond their understanding. Quincy defies him, insisting she must reach Broken Bow to find her family. Dinh’s ultimatum: stay in comfort, return to a slave cell, or be buried—she will remain. He admits he only truly cares about holding onto Margdelain’s son and leaves Lenya to deal with Quincy. The scene solidifies their captivity, exposes Quincy as a paid-for target, confirms Chase’s identity is known, and hints at larger threats binding the holdfast.",
