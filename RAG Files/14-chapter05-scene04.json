    "full_scene_clean": "Three hours later, two hours past dawn, Quincy finished dragging three bodies out of the clearing and covering them with leaves, sticks, and a thin skin of soil. Insects and birds hammered at her nerves. Demmy returned then, mud-smeared and buzzing, guiding the cart into the clearing. He reported a mass of ravagers headed back toward their camp; he had drawn them off, hidden submerged beneath roots in a bog for hours, and only just slipped back. Quincy, spent and shaking, steadied herself on a tree and admitted she hadn’t thought he would return. She handed him a handsaw and the shotgun, told him to cut and stack brush to camouflage the clearing. With water and a ration bar, she forced her breathing even and went to work. She kit-bashed a steering system from both buggies: hacksawing and filing parts until the linkage worked. It would have slop and need overcorrection, but the frame was sturdy and the motor coils strong. She put their batteries on charge with the salvaged solar mat and flat panel, left the worst three batteries to save weight, and planned to supplement charging on the move with the small alcohol fuel cell. By her mental math, they could now run fast enough to keep pace with, maybe even gain on, the caravan. Demmy finished the brush blind and napped, waking as she tightened the last fasteners. “It’ll do, but I need sleep,” she said, assigning him watch. Exhaustion took her and she dropped into deep sleep.",
    "dense_recap_250w": "At first light, Quincy finishes burying three bodies near the forest clearing when Demmy finally returns with their cart. He explains his absence: he spotted a large ravager element moving toward the area, deliberately drew them away from the two-seater, and lay hidden under tree roots in a bog for hours before creeping back. Quincy, frayed and dizzy, admits she had assumed he was gone; Demmy doesn’t argue. She channels the surge of adrenaline and anger into action, arming Demmy with the shotgun and a handsaw and assigning him to cut and stack brush to hide their position. She eats, drinks, then focuses on the machines. Using parts from both vehicles, she fabricates a working steering linkage with a hacksaw and files. The result is functional but imprecise, requiring overcorrection at speed. She optimizes their power plan: puts their mixed batteries on charge using a salvaged solar charging mat and a flat rigid panel, discards the three weakest batteries to reduce mass, and intends to top up while driving with a small alcohol fuel cell. Her quick energy budget suggests they can now travel quickly enough to keep up with, and possibly gain on, the Three Shovels caravan. Demmy completes a brush blind, naps, and wakes as she finishes. Quincy orders a watch schedule, then collapses into deep, dreamless sleep, their departure contingent on a quiet perimeter and her recovery.",
