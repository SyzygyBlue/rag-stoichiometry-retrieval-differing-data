    "full_scene_clean": "Quincy, Demmy, and Lesha haul the broken Chase away from the burning Calum-Tam Holdfast toward Demmy’s parked TEG-6. Demmy estimates ~600 meters, avoiding traps he scouted on approach. Ahead, a ravagered-up Gavin appears with a submachine gun and blocks them, vowing revenge on Quincy. Lesha, heavily augmented, walks through his burst, rips the SMG from him, and smashes him down. Quincy takes the SMG and demands information. Gavin confirms Jessop and ravager boss Makko are building and equipping a holy ravager army with vast holocreds, via a Metrofederacy corporate contract executed by the Blacklight Syndicate. The name rattles Lesha; she urges killing Gavin to prevent word getting out. Quincy presses about the caravan; Gavin claims Davian cast him out after he hit Quincy, then rants that she ruined him. Demmy recites Zephaniah about wrath and judgment and says, “Send him.” Quincy fires the remaining rounds into Gavin, then hurls the empty SMG. They load Chase into the TEG-6. Destination: Fox River for medical care. Demmy confirms the scripture source. As Quincy keys the nav and the vehicle rolls out, Lesha, suddenly alarmed, says, “Guys…”",
    "dense_recap_250w": "Dragging the gravely injured Chase from the burning Calum-Tam Holdfast, Quincy, Demmy, and Lesha make for Demmy’s TEG-6, skirting traps he’d marked earlier. A ravager-styled Gavin confronts them with a submachine gun and promises to take from Quincy what she took from him. Lesha, her body armored by augmentations, soaks the burst, disarms him, and drops him with a brutal backhand. Given the SMG, Quincy forces information: Gavin says priest Jessop and ravager boss Makko are assembling and equipping a fanatic army with huge flows of holocreds, through a Metrofederacy corporate deal, executed by the Blacklight Syndicate. The Blacklight name shocks Lesha, who insists Gavin must die so their survival isn’t reported. Quincy demands news of the caravan; Gavin, embittered, says Davian threw him out after he hit Quincy and offers nothing useful. Demmy quotes Zephaniah on divine wrath and, with an impassive “Send him,” green-lights execution. Quincy empties the SMG into Gavin and, when it clicks empty, throws it at him. With gunfire and screams behind them, they strap Chase into the TEG-6 to head for Fox River’s medics. When Quincy asks, Demmy confirms the verse was from the Book of Zephaniah. As they roll out, Lesha grips the seat, eyes going wide, warning, “Guys…,” leaving a tense cliffhanger.",
