    "full_scene_clean": "Fay sat cross-legged, hovering centimeters above the floor, her spectral form observing Skree—unaware these were her final hours in the holo. Skree’s physical body would soon be boxed and shipped to Li Mei’s handlers. Li Mei had teams combing Skree’s interface code for back doors and logic bombs. Fay had left decoys—obvious traps—to keep them busy and to avoid raising suspicion. Once the handoff occurred, Fay would lose all contact. Skree’s control matrices were shielded by advanced AEGIS, and Skree was hardwired not to perceive them. Li Mei also masked the handlers’ identity: objectives would arrive via a hardened security digest to an artificial third node in Skree’s brain, which would translate orders into intuitions and neurochemical prompts—an “unbreakable leash.” “Only virtually impenetrable,” Fay murmured. In the simulated world Skree believed real, a klaxon sounded; the scripted attack against Cryodyne—the mostly fictitious company Skree “worked” for—began in VR, forcing her to flee. These were the last minutes Fay would see Skree, for now. A girl needs options. As long as no one could do what Fay could, she could get away with almost anything. Skree’s PID populated with alerts. With a flick of her lingual interface, Fay piggybacked on Skree’s optics to watch what Skree saw.",
    "dense_recap_250w": "At Tahua Outpost’s Special Projects Three, Fay observes her creation, Skree, inside a VR ‘holo’ environment during the final minutes before a control transfer to Li Mei’s network. Anticipating code audits, Fay previously planted obvious decoy back doors and logic bombs so Li Mei’s consultants would find and remove them, satisfying suspicion while protecting Fay’s true options. After the handoff, Fay expects to lose direct access: Skree’s control matrices are wrapped in top-tier AEGIS defenses, Skree is hardwired not to perceive them, and all operational orders will be routed through an encrypted digest into an artificial ‘third node’ in Skree’s brain that converts instructions into intuitions and neurochemical cues—intended as an unbreakable leash. Fay considers it only ‘virtually’ impenetrable. A scripted attack on ‘Cryodyne’—a mostly fictitious employer front within the simulation—kicks off on cue, designed to force Skree to flee and thus transition into the next phase under Li Mei’s handlers. As alarms blare and data flood Skree’s PID, Fay uses her lingual interface to piggyback Skree’s optics, ensuring real-time visibility in these last moments of access. The scene frames a power struggle of authorship and control around Skree: Fay’s covert safeguards vs. Li Mei’s compartmentalized command chain.",
