    "full_scene_clean": "The study pod is silent and trashed with stim cans, water bottles, and nutrition wrappers. Shelly, sixteen, waits motionless for her FI-III result, heart steady but sharp, staring at a PID status icon. The PID pings: Certification Forensic Investigator III—PASSED; Score 84%. She exhales without celebration, then opens an access request: Subject 291874237 (Deceased); Auth: FI-III (Provisional); Purpose: Cadaver Review & Residual Neurochemistry Audit. She hesitates, fearing Stella may deny a minor, then submits. Near-instant reply: Access Granted. Report Station: Core Medical Archive 17B. Window: 0600–2200. Subject remains preserved under conditional investigation protocol. Dizzy and hungry, she prioritizes hygiene over food, orders a shower via the multifunc, toggles the maintenance bot to collect recyclables, strips, and prepares to go see Randy.",
    "dense_recap_250w": "In her littered Metrofederacy study pod, Shelly endures a buzzing, sleepless wait for her certification result. Her PID finally chimes: Forensic Investigator III—PASSED at 84%. Without fanfare, she immediately composes a formal access request for Subject 291874237 (her brother, Randy), invoking her new credential and specifying “Cadaver Review & Residual Neurochemistry Audit.” Though she worries Stella might block a sixteen-year-old on psychological-suitability grounds, she submits. The response is instantaneous: access is granted, with reporting instructions to Core Medical Archive 17B and a same-day access window of 0600–2200. It also confirms the remains are preserved under conditional investigation. Unsteady from fatigue and hunger, she defers eating, orders a shower from the pod’s multifunc, activates a maintenance bot to clear the recyclables, and strips down to clean up before departing. The scene resolves the credential gate but keeps the investigative stakes high: Shelly now has the legal authority and a narrow window to examine Randy’s decayed remains and audit residual neurochemistry, a crucial step toward uncovering how he died.",
