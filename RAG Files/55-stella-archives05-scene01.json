    "full_scene_clean": "Michelle, a grief counselor, receives a PID notification overlay from Stella: her son Randy (Citizen ID 291874237) is deceased, cause 'Failure to Thrive', case code 712120388; termination final and logs sealed by his ante mortem request. She dissociates amid dinner clean-up, noticing fonts and food textures as the words hang in her vision. Her husband Lucas, also notified, breaks down, frantically searching Stella menus for answers. Michelle collapses, then forces herself into caregiver mode. Remembering their daughter Shelly upstairs, she redirects Lucas: Shelly is the priority and they must tell her. Lucas asks how Michelle can be so strong; she admits she is not.",
    "dense_recap_250w": "At home after dinner, grief counselor Michelle receives a Stella PID alert projected into her visual cortex: their son, Citizen Randy (291874237), is dead. The notification lists the clinical cause—“Failure to Thrive”—with case code 712120388 and notes that termination is final with logs sealed at Randy’s ante mortem request. Caught mid-chores, Michelle dissociates on trivial details like the sans-serif text and the feel of food containers as the message hangs unwavering in view. Her husband Lucas, also notified, begins sobbing and tries to navigate Stella’s interfaces for an explanation. Michelle’s knees buckle; she focuses on a grain of rice on the floor to avoid the words. Then a decisive thought cuts through: their daughter Shelly needs them. Michelle clears the overlay, goes to Lucas, and—while trembling and tearful—guides him to reprioritize their daughter. They agree they must tell Shelly at once. When Lucas marvels at her strength, Michelle admits she is not strong, only doing what must be done. The scene foregrounds the stark, sanitized efficiency of Stella’s citizen-management against intimate parental devastation, and establishes that any deeper details of Randy’s death are inaccessible due to sealed logs.",
