    "full_scene_clean": "That night, Quincy's dreams clawed at her—hollow-eyed refugees and Robyn's smile colliding in a blur of fire, blood, and gold. She woke gasping, heart pounding, the tent pressing in like damp cloth. Blanket off, then on—too cold without it, too much scent with it. Robyn. Her hair. Her skin. She turned to the canvas and breathed. Focus. Just breathe. A sound outside—faint voices, not snores. Words drifted through the fabric: \"Didn't think she'd last—\" \"—sure there'd be a brawl by now.\" A betting pool. On her. She almost laughed. Almost. If Robyn hadn't made her promise, she'd have given them a show. She stared up, everything burning—eyes, throat, fists. None of it mattered. Mama Valorie's \"for the good of the caravan\" was a lie. Skervs came every market day, some practically throwing babies at them. If Mama wanted children, she could take them. She's doing it to provoke me, Quincy thought. She curled tighter, shivering but not cold. I'm not one of her well-behaved women. Night sounds: a fart, snores, someone having sex, the caravan humming low. Quincy clutched the blanket, mind circling Robyn's laugh, Valorie's voice, the weight in her chest. She forced distraction: torque specs, gear ratios—eighty-six newton-meters on housing bolts, M12 thread, seven-point-two turns before seat. She chanted them like a prayer. It didn't help. The emptiness had teeth.",
    "dense_recap_250w": "In the Three Shovels camp at night, Quincy wakes from nightmares that fuse images of starving refugees with memories of Robyn. Suffocating in the tent’s closeness and Robyn’s scent clinging to her blanket, she tries controlled breathing until faint voices outside catch her attention. She overhears caravanners gambling on whether she would start a fight in response to Robyn’s forced pairing with Gavin. The mockery stings, but what bites deeper is her belief that Mama Valorie’s justification—\"for the good of the caravan\"—is a pretext; if children were the goal, the caravan could take in skerv babies offered during market days. Quincy reframes it as provocation aimed at her noncompliance. Surrounded by the intimate, indifferent sounds of communal camp life—snores, a fart, a couple having sex—she tightens in on herself, trying to blunt the ache. She turns to the one refuge that usually works: mechanical numbers and procedures. She recites torque specs, thread sizes, and turn counts in a mental litany, seeking the safe rules of machines. But even this technical mantra can’t muffle the hurt tonight. The scene closes with Quincy awake in the dark, clinging to the blanket, recognizing that the emptiness she feels is predatory—\"the emptiness had teeth.\"",
