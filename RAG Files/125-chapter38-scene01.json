    "full_scene_clean": "Master Scrivener Francis announces Brother Olafsen, who brings a letter from Chase and screenshots tied to a ravager datapad Evelyn borrowed from Demmy. Olafsen reports church higher-ups were monitoring the device, abducted Evelyn, and took the datapad; he fears Demmy is descending to the lower levels to rescue her, citing violent scripture and warning innocents be cleared. Margdelain feigns concern, asks for copies, and secretly sends sublingual orders: contact McTanner to recover the datapad and mobilize the TRG to secure the barred lower levels under the cover of a crime scene. Internally, she intends to use the crisis to destroy Brother Jessop politically, possibly elevate Olafsen, and later spin Demmy as a hero if he survives. As Olafsen departs, she receives confirmation McTanner’s forces are moving, pours whiskey, and reflects on never wasting a good crisis.",
    "dense_recap_250w": "In her Fox River office, Chancellor Margdelain receives Brother Olafsen, who brings a letter from her son Chase to Demmy and screenshots of messages tied to a ravager datapad. Olafsen explains Evelyn borrowed Demmy’s captured device; senior clergy monitored it, abducted her, and seized the datapad minutes after it came online. He fears Demmy is already infiltrating the forbidden lower levels to rescue Evelyn, empowered by biblical justifications and the will to harm those responsible. Margdelain outwardly expresses alarm and promises to alert the TRG, while internally she sees opportunity: she privately orders Master Scrivener Francis (via sublingual message) to have McTanner retrieve the datapad and mobilize the TRG to take the long-barred lower levels as a crime scene, planning to end Brother Jessop’s political campaign against her. She resolves to leverage any evidence found—or fabricate it amid the chaos—and considers rewarding Olafsen and even decorating Demmy if he survives. As Olafsen leaves, Margdelain’s aural implant confirms McTanner’s forces are already moving. She toasts the moment with whiskey, thinking, “Never waste a good crisis,” recognizing the situation as a gift to consolidate power and neutralize the church’s interference.",
