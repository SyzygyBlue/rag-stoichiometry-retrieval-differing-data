    "full_scene_clean": "Before he ever sat in the TEG-2, Chase had already made the real decision. The morning after confronting his mother, images of her control pressed on him as he walked to the TRG armory to see Master McTanner. Dropping the chin-up posture his mother taught him, he approached with open vulnerability. McTanner eyed him: “You’re here to cause me trouble, aren’t you?” Chase admitted he had told his mother he would not apprentice with the diplomatic corps and asked to start an apprenticeship with the TRG, under McTanner. McTanner frowned: the TRG was where kids with no options went; Chase was turning down a life handed to him. Chase replied he needed to find out who he was: “Do you know what it feels like to slowly disappear? … I’d like to find out while I still have the chance.” McTanner warned that the Chancellor was his boss and would pull strings; no favors would be allowed; this road would be harder than Chase thought. Chase insisted: he didn’t want guarantees, only a chance; he wanted to earn something, not have it handed to him. After a long look, McTanner sighed and shook his hand. He couldn’t promise anything but would call Chancellor Margdelain to explain the request. He cautioned Chase to keep his head down and return to his dorm: “This is far from over—it’s your mother we’re talking about.” Chase left with relief and a sense of purpose.",
    "dense_recap_250w": "Reeling the morning after defying Chancellor Margdelain, his adoptive mother, Chase goes to the Fox River armory to speak with Master McTanner, head of the Tactical Response Group (TRG). Abandoning his mother’s coached bravado, he asks plainly to begin an apprenticeship with the TRG instead of the diplomatic career she arranged. McTanner is unsurprised but troubled: the TRG traditionally takes those without options, and Margdelain remains McTanner’s boss. He warns Chase that she will exert control, that no special treatment will be allowed, and that the path will be harder than Chase imagines. Chase explains his motive: he feels himself disappearing under others’ expectations and wants to earn an identity through the rigor and risk McTanner has taught him to respect. He does not ask for guarantees, only a chance. After a long appraisal, McTanner relents enough to act procedurally: he will call the Chancellor to explain the request but offers no promises. He advises Chase to keep a low profile and return to his dorm, reiterating that the situation is far from settled. The scene closes with a handshake, a stern warning, and Chase departing with relief and renewed purpose despite the looming influence of Margdelain over TRG command.",
