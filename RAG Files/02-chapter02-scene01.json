    "full_scene_clean": "At dawn on a lone hill, the Three Shovels Caravan forms two defensive rings of trucks and trailers, scissor-lift machine guns scanning the horizon as skervs limp in from the brush to trade. Inside the circle, tarps drip condensation, woodsmoke and sourdough cut against the ever-present smell of decay. Quincy, fresh from the toilet trench, trades barbs with Mama Valorie, who pushes her toward women’s work; Quincy dodges and heads to her tent. She bumps into Andreu, who invites her to an Even-Odds dice night in the Wildebeest—holos on the table and harsh puro to drink. The prospect lifts her mood. She goes to fix Gooch’s slipping clutch. Robyn arrives, slides under the truck, kisses Quincy, and fusses about her oversized hand-me-down coveralls, offering to tailor them. Quincy bristles at Mama Valorie’s refusal to outfit her with proper gear and at caravan expectations that women preserve vegetables while she wants to wrench and work vendor tables. Robyn counsels patience and stealth: play by the rules in small steps to avoid exile, invoking Marco as a cautionary tale. Quincy yields—for Robyn’s sake if not from belief—promising to leave the coveralls for sewing before heading to the vendor booths. Robyn sends her off with love and a promise that things will work out.",
    "dense_recap_250w": "At a fortified dawn encampment in the Oklahoma wildlands, the Three Shovels Caravan prepares for a trading day as skervs drift in from makeshift shelters. Quincy resists Mama Valorie’s gendered assignment to the women’s preservation line, citing mechanical duties on Gooch’s slipping clutch and a shift at the vendor tables. Andreu invites her to a raucous Even-Odds dice game in the Wildebeest with holos and the caravan’s brutal puro. Under the truck, Robyn joins Quincy, their intimacy evident as she kisses her, worries about Quincy’s ill-fitting coveralls, and offers to tailor them. Robyn argues for a strategy of incremental conformity—\"thread the needle\"—to win acceptance and avoid expulsion, recalling Marco’s exile for defying Davian. Quincy, who trusts machines more than people, chafes at the caravan’s norms but agrees to small, careful steps out of love for Robyn: leave the coveralls for alterations, then work the vendor tables. The scene establishes the caravan’s precarious economy and security posture, the desperation of nearby skervs, and the internal social tension between tradition and individual competence, foregrounding Quincy and Robyn’s secret relationship and their tactical patience within a rigid community.",
