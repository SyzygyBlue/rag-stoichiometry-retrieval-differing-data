    "full_scene_clean": "The late afternoon sun cast long shadows as they stopped for another battery swap. After connecting the terminals, Quincy went to the dash, toggled the mains, and checked the meter. \"Seventy-six percent,\" she said. Demmy, eager to help, returned the exhausted batteries to the storage rack and hooked up the charging harness. Quincy had given him some basic instruction, and he grinned when the charging indicator illuminated. The flat panel solar cell remained on top of the cart. The folding mat, deployed in the grass, drank in the day's final rays of sun. Quincy unscrewed the cap from the fuel cell's ethanol tank.\n\"Not much left,\" Quincy said. \"Might as well use it now, I suppose. I guess it's time for redline or go blind.\"\n\"I'm pretty sure I know what that means,\" Demmy said. \"But tell me anyway.\"\n\"It's a caravanner term. It means a balls-out run, no holding nothing back. Run 'em till we get there or we melt 'em down.\"\nThey compare options and risks. If they miss the caravan, they will straight-line to Broken Bow Free City off the trade routes, hoping the cart holds together. A low thrumming swells from the south—something big and electric. A black dot grows rapidly.\n\"Flyer... maybe a Pentafan,\" Quincy says. The massive gray aircraft booms overhead at under two hundred meters—an ovoid fuselage with five gimbaled thrusters on stalks. The scream of electric motors and buffeting wind hammer them; dust and grass whip their faces. In seconds it recedes northward.\nShaken, Demmy lowers his shotgun. Quincy, spitting dust, guesses Metrofederacy—only they have that kind of resource—and says wildlanders are beneath notice. Blackbirds gather to feast on stirred grasshoppers. Demmy laughs with wonder; he wants to ride in one someday. Quincy claps his shoulder, calling him something else, but worries again: what if Davian says no? Demmy warns it's too dangerous to drive at night—they'll wreck. Quincy agrees. They stow gear, fold the charging mat, and after a short search pick a spot to camp, planning to leave at first light.",
    "dense_recap_250w": "Quincy and Demmy pause in late afternoon on the plains for a battery swap and system check—mains toggled, meter at 76%. Demmy, newly trained, racks the spent packs and hooks the charging harness while a flat solar panel and a folding mat sip the last sun. Fuel-cell ethanol is nearly gone, prompting Quincy to propose “redline or go blind,” an all-out push until they arrive or the machine melts down. They debate contingencies if they don’t find Three Shovels and consider straight-lining for Broken Bow off trade routes to avoid bandits. A growing electric thrumming draws their eyes south: a huge ovoid aircraft with five gimbaled thrusters—likely a Metrofederacy Pentafan—screams overhead at low altitude, blasting them with dust and turbulence before streaking away north. Quincy frames themselves as insignificant to such power. Demmy, trembling with his shotgun, shifts to awe and dreams of riding one. Quincy, privately anxious about Davian possibly rejecting Demmy, packs up. Demmy vetoes night driving as too dangerous; Quincy agrees. They secure the charging setup, fold the mat, and find a campsite to depart at first light.",
