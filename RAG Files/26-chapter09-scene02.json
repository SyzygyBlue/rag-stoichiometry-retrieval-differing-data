    "full_scene_clean": "The line of trucks screeched to a halt, blocked by a makeshift barricade of tires and barbed wire—a semicircle of death in the heart of the enemy camp. Rocky outcrops hemmed them in. Ravagers swarmed on all sides, taking cover behind vehicles. Bullets rained down, pinging metal, punching holes—wounding… killing.\nDavian climbed out, rifle in one hand and a wired microphone in the other. Everyone with a rifle and all four machine gunners kept hammering the enemy. “We need a hole!” he shouted, pointing at the wall.\nQuincy jumped from the truck roof. Andreu sprinted with wire cutters but a shot tore through his back and chest, dropping him. Quincy grabbed the cutters—and Andreu’s .45—ditching her long gun for close-quarters fighting. She ran to the tires and cut wire after wire while debris and bullets whipped past. Bodies of caravanners lay torn around her as others rushed in to replace the fallen and heave on the piles.\n“Cut this wire!” Gavin yelled, holding a strand. Their eyes met for an instant; Quincy cut it and moved on.\nA ravager two-seater slammed into a truck; return fire killed the driver. The gaunt kid fell off a truck in the chaos. Three Shovels pushed and the tire wall began to topple. With women and machine gunners covering, they cleared a path. Quincy spotted Robyn prone, feeding shells into a bolt-action, pride cutting through her fear.\nIn the end, twenty-six caravanners lay dead or dying. A child screamed from a shattered window as women dragged survivors back to the trucks. “It’s wide enough. Let’s go!” Davian yelled, circling a finger as he climbed into the lead truck.\n“Let’s go get that kid,” Gavin told Quincy, pointing to a tiny shed. They ran. A driverless two-seater clipped the shed, snapping a post; it began to collapse. Quincy looked up—Gavin stood over her, face twisted, pistol raised like a hammer. “Gavin,” she croaked… the pistol fell.\nWhite-hot pain—then darkness.",
    "dense_recap_250w": "The Three Shovels convoy is forced to a stop inside a ravager encampment by a semicircular barricade of tires and barbed wire, with rocky outcrops hemming them in and enemy fire raking the trucks. Davian dismounts with a wired mic and orders a breach. Andreu rushes forward carrying wire cutters but is shot through the back and chest. Quincy sprints under fire, retrieves Andreu’s wire cutters and his holstered .45, prioritizes a handgun for the close fight, and discards her long rifle. She attacks the barrier, clipping wires as caravanners repeatedly hurl their weight into the tire wall. Gavin briefly coordinates, calling her to cut a strand he holds. A ravager two-seater caroms off a truck before its driver is shot; a gaunt refugee kid falls near a small shed. With covering fire from the women and four machine gunners, the wall rocks, topples, and a lane is cleared. Robyn is spotted prone, calmly cycling a bolt-action while feeding rounds. The cost is severe: twenty-six caravanners lie dead or dying; a child screams from a shot-out window as women haul survivors back to the trucks. Davian signals the roll-out. Gavin taps Quincy and points to the kid; they sprint to the shed as a driverless two-seater clips it, breaking a support. As the shed collapses, Gavin looms over Quincy, face twisted, pistol raised like a hammer. She manages “Gavin”—then the pistol comes down. A burst of white-hot pain ends the scene.",
