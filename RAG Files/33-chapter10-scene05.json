    "full_scene_clean": "There were several corpses on Dorothy Dix, the med bus—friends torn apart by ravager bullets. The blood smell belonged to people Quincy loved. Robyn was not among them, a relief that felt cruel. Rigor had set in; broken glass crunched underfoot. Quincy gasped at Margaritte on a gurney, her measurement slate still in her pocket, a bullet hole through her ribs. No one alive. Quincy stepped out, forced herself calm, and chose a cold fury.\nThey searched trucks—engines still on. Quincy shut them down to save batteries. “Why would they leave the trucks running?” Demmy found a cracked camera and pocketed it. Quincy scanned the handheld radio: mostly static, then ravager chatter—shrill voices, laughter, thrash metal. Demmy identified Sykotiq gibber. A calm baritone cut through: “Jackrabbit, this is Makko… any status on the wolfpack?” Jackrabbit replied negative but said a team was tracking. Makko ordered updates.\nDemmy pointed at the silent ravager line: likely the “wolfpack.” Quincy refused to abandon the caravan. They entered the command trailer; Quincy pulled coordinates from a datapad and traced a route. “They were going to Fox River,” she said—an independent, well-defended city. She set the Fox River com frequency and hailed. “Quincy, this is Chase from Fox River. Where did you guys go?” Quincy reported ravagers incoming and gave coordinates. Chase said he was on his way; Quincy told him to wait for the rest and that they were minutes out.\nDemmy urged retreat; Quincy instead committed to a stand: “If we operate the guns, that will be three; hold a bit and Fox River can arrive.” She ran to a truck, climbed her machine-gun platform, and waited for the approaching storm—ready to hold or die trying.",
    "dense_recap_250w": "Quincy and Demmy search the silent Three Shovels formation and find Dorothy Dix, the med bus, full of slain caravanners including Margaritte. Robyn is not among the dead, giving Quincy painful hope. Outside, Quincy discovers multiple trucks inexplicably left running and shuts them down to preserve batteries. Demmy pockets a cracked camera. Scanning a salvaged handheld radio yields mostly static and ravager chatter; Demmy identifies Sykotiq-fueled gibber. Clear voices break in: a calm operator “Makko” asks “Jackrabbit” for status on the “wolfpack,” suggesting a returning raider group tied to the empty ravager vehicles nearby. Demmy argues to flee before ravagers arrive, but Quincy insists on understanding what happened. In the command trailer, she uses a datapad to get coordinates and notes the caravan’s intended destination: Fox River, an independent, well-armed city. She sets their com code and reaches “Chase” at Fox River, reports ravagers inbound, and transmits coordinates; Chase starts to respond, but Quincy tells him to wait for the rest while she and Demmy will hold. Despite Demmy’s protest that staying is suicidal, Quincy commits to manning a truck-mounted gun, reasoning that with Chase plus their guns they can delay attackers until Fox River’s reinforcements arrive. She climbs her machine-gun platform, prepared to defend her home and buy time.",
