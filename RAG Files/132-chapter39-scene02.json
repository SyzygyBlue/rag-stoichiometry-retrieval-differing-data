    "full_scene_clean": "At a massive metal door with a yellow-lit pad, Demmy tries palm and red card—no luck—then hears a shout for security. He uses the yellow card; the pad turns green and the lock clicks. As the door opens from the other side, he stabs the entrant in the neck with bloody scissors and pushes through. Two robed men charge with clubs: Demmy catches one’s swing with the scissor handle and drives a letter opener through his larynx; he dodges the second’s telegraphed strike and finishes him with scissor thrusts under the chin and into the spine. A scream of “DEMMY!” freezes him—Evelyn is held at knifepoint by an older priest; she’s bruised, lip split, fingers broken. A massive cleric with a spiked mace rushes Demmy. Barefoot and agile, Demmy feints toward an office, pivots close to nullify the weapon, inflicts wounds to the side, back, and knee, gets grabbed, then blinds the man with a letter opener to the eye and ends him with repeated neck thrusts. The older cleric presses the knife deeper, taunts that he tortured Evelyn, and orders Demmy to leave. Demmy, sobbing, admits he gave her the ravager datapad. A rifle crack explodes; the older cleric’s skull bursts—shot by gray-haired, armored McTanner. TRG fighters flood in, subdue remaining clergy, and begin seizing records. Demmy cradles Evelyn; she whispers she didn’t tell. Paramedics take her toward the med bay. McTanner promises justice and notes Margdelain has long awaited this purge, though Jessop is still at large. Ascending the stairs, Demmy reflects that the scripture he repeated—“The avenger shall put the murderer to death”—no longer fully defines him; he hopes Evelyn will heal and forgive him.",
    "dense_recap_250w": "Demmy reaches a secured lower-wing door, fails with palm and a red card, but the yellow card unlocks it as alarms rise. He kills the first man as the door opens, then defeats two club-wielding robed men with a mix of scissor strikes and a letter opener to the larynx. A heavyweight cleric armed with a brutal spiked mace charges; Demmy uses footwork, close-in angles, and multiple punctures (side, back, knee, eye) before finishing him with repeated scissor thrusts. The fight halts when an older cleric holds Evelyn at knifepoint—she’s visibly tortured and injured. Demmy threatens revenge but can’t close the distance without getting her killed; the cleric gloats about torturing her and the datapad. When Demmy admits he gave it to her, a single sniper-precise shot from gray-haired, armored McTanner blows out the captor’s skull. TRG units pour in, secure the area, and collect datapads, logs, and storage devices as evidence. Evelyn, insisting she never talked, is taken by paramedics to the med bay. McTanner assures Demmy that Chancellor Margdelain intends to dismantle the corrupt faction, though Jessop remains missing. As they leave the lower levels, Demmy realizes the vengeance verse that fueled him no longer fully matches who he is; he resolves to grow in faith while still ready to cut down evil if called, and he hopes Evelyn can recover—and forgive.",
