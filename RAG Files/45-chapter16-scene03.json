    "full_scene_clean": "A nurse changes Chase’s bandages on the bullet-scarred med bus while Quincy recounts to Investigator Liebold how she was left behind by a man named Gavin, then fought back with Demmy by stealing and repairing carts. Outside, TRG mechanics and salvage crews work; a quadrafan lands with supplies. Quincy mentions a huge pentafan that flew over from this direction. Liebold orders gas analysis of grass/topsoil for fast-acting sedatives. McTanner posits the pentafan could have carried off the entire caravan and says they’ll wait on forensics. Quincy, shaken, agrees—reluctantly and for lack of options—to let TRG drivers take the Three Shovels Caravan to Fox River for safekeeping and investigation, then goes to be alone in a nearby trailer. McTanner sits with Chase and delivers a hard reprimand: Chase disobeyed scouting orders, forced a hot entry, and risked the team. He ends Chase’s TRG apprenticeship despite acknowledging his marksmanship, and tells him they roll out tomorrow for Fox River.",
    "dense_recap_250w": "On the Dorothea Dix med bus, a nurse tends Chase’s stab wound while Quincy, McTanner, and Investigator Liebold debrief. Quincy explains she was knocked out and abandoned by Gavin, then, with Demmy, infiltrated a ravager camp, killed hostiles, and limped stolen carts back toward the caravan. Activity outside underscores TRG control of the site as salvage crews and mechanics work and a quadrafan brings supplies. Quincy recalls a massive five-rotor aircraft—a pentafan—flying overhead, likely from the valley’s direction. Seizing on the lead, Liebold orders a gas analyzer check of flattened grass and topsoil for fast-acting sedatives, probing a theory that the missing caravaners were rendered unconscious and airlifted. McTanner connects the dots: downdraft-flattened grass and the pentafan’s size could explain the disappearance. Quincy, rattled, agrees that TRG drivers can convoy the entire Three Shovels Caravan to Fox River for safekeeping and investigation, though she hates the necessity. After Quincy leaves to gather herself, McTanner confronts Chase: instead of scouting as ordered, Chase initiated long-range engagements that forced TRG to attack blind, risking everyone. McTanner ends Chase’s provisional apprenticeship, telling him they depart tomorrow and to try not to take it too hard—while stressing the lesson in team risk over individual heroics.",
