    "full_scene_clean": "Romuald Anwar, CEO of Teragen, waits in an empty conference room at Thórsmörk Palace, Industry Party HQ, after being 'invited'—without real choice—to meet Chairman Cervantes Adlawan. He debates fleeing by suborbital but stays, rattled by an ultimatum: integrate one hundred million new citizens in ten months. Adlawan arrives, confident and unsparing. Romuald argues the plan is impossible; Stella’s models and buffers will fail under a sudden surge, risking misclassifications, public distrust, and systemic collapse. Adlawan counters with political inevitability, citing Humanity Party Chairman Giles Montague’s persuasive campaign and a holographic population countdown that frames inaction as complicity in rising wildlands deaths. He shares a recent tri-D drone video of a ravager-razed holdfast and a maimed child crawling through the ruins. Shaken, Romuald concedes the pressure is unstoppable. He proposes a long-shot contingency Teragen has been simulating: temporarily reintroduce human auditors—triple-blind—to stabilize throughput while models retrain. Adlawan, grim but resolute, accepts the only viable play and requests specs for the new career type. He delivers the ultimatum: ten months to make it work. Romuald leaves under the weight of the deadline and the world it threatens.",
    "dense_recap_250w": "At Thórsmörk Palace, Chairman Cervantes Adlawan informs Teragen CEO Romuald Anwar that the Humanity Party will force a rules update to integrate 100 million wildlanders into Stella within ten months. Romuald argues this rapid expansion will overwhelm Stella’s non-buffered processing, spike misclassifications, and trigger a cascading collapse of SAIR rankings, trust, and public order. Adlawan cites political inevitability—Giles Montague’s real-time mortality display and council pressure—and shares a fresh tri-D drone feed of a devastated holdfast and a grievously injured child to convey urgency. Cornered by moral and political forces, Romuald offers a radical mitigation: temporarily add human auditors under triple-blind verification to absorb load while retraining models and scaling infrastructure. Adlawan accepts the approach, asks for formal specs for a new auditor career type, and sets a firm ten-month deadline. The scene establishes stakes (civilizational stability versus humanitarian crisis), clarifies system constraints (Stella has no backlog/buffer and degrades catastrophically if behind), and introduces a controversial compromise (human bias reintroduced under controls) as the only near-term path to avert failure.",
