    "full_scene_clean": "Two ravagers lay dead near a small camp—one from a festering wound, the other with a skull caved in and the stink of puro heavy in the air. An old skerv had sorted their meager kit: batteries, shotgun shells, cloudy binoculars, a crusty revolver, and a battered alcohol fuel cell half-full of puro. Quincy looked on the skerv’s body with regret. Demmy called him a ‘jackal’—a night predator who murders the weak—then produced a pouch of trophies: bent glasses, a cheap watch, gold teeth, and a wooden cross, proof (to Demmy) of violent theft. He explained jackal methods and the hard calculus of skerv survival; Quincy admitted caravanners might be naïve or willfully blind. Demmy told a fragment of his past—selling his mother’s bible and cross for water—and warned that in the wildlands you make bargains, not choices. Work resumed: Quincy inspected the ravager two-seater and judged a motor transplant impossible in the field (different mounts; axial vs under-mount). The steering was wrecked—twisted tie rods of tempered steel. She formed a plan to stare-and-compare parts between vehicles and asked Demmy to fetch their buggy. Before he left with the shotgun, Quincy kicked dirt over the fire to kill the light and began sorting the ravager’s broken tools, determined to build one working machine.",
    "dense_recap_250w": "Quincy and Demmy survey a grim scene: two dead ravagers and the old skerv Quincy shot earlier. The air reeks of puro and blood. Among scavenged items the skerv had piled—batteries, shotgun shells, worn binoculars, a corroded revolver, and a battered alcohol fuel cell—Demmy finds a pouch holding bent glasses, a cheap watch, gold teeth, and a wooden cross. He argues these tokens identify the skerv as a ‘jackal’: a night-stalking murderer who kills sleepers with rocks and strips victims, sometimes pulling teeth from the living. Quincy struggles with guilt and with the broader complicity of caravan trade, admitting caravanners can be naïve or choose not to ask questions. Demmy counters that morality is a luxury skervs can’t afford and recounts selling his dead mother’s bible and cross for water. Refocusing on survival, Quincy evaluates the disabled ravager two-seater: a field motor swap won’t work due to incompatible mounts (axial face vs under-mount), and the steering is ruined with twisted, tempered tie rods. She proposes cannibalizing parts between the ravager buggy and their own to assemble one functional machine. Demmy goes to retrieve their hidden buggy and advises extinguishing the campfire to avoid drawing more predators. Quincy kicks dirt over the embers and starts laying out tools, pushing aside junk and planning the mix-and-match repair.",
