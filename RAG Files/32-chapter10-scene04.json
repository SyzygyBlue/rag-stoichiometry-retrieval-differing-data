    "full_scene_clean": "Despite several crushing bumps, Quincy pushed the two-seater onward; reaching the caravan was crucial. They woke before dawn and rolled at first light. The fuel cell drained most of the remaining puro overnight but added a few percent charge. To avoid hidden obstacles, Quincy aimed for shorter grass, but tall grass and airborne debris still pelted them. Demmy spotted a dust cloud: a vehicle headed their way. He warned against slowing or steering away. Quincy scowled, kept speed, and played along as if they were fellow ravagers. Demmy readied the shotgun; Quincy wished for a rifle. They decided to close and, at the first hostile tell, blast the windscreen.\nThey smeared soot from the shotgun barrel under their eyes to look more ravager. The approaching four-seater was a wobbling wreck, blaring speed metal, its occupants head-banging. At arm’s length, Demmy fired—click. He racked another shell as both ravagers scrambled for guns. His second shot erased the passenger’s face. Quincy’s .45 automag dropped the driver as a round from the ravagers dented the tube frame above her head, fragmenting and cutting her cheek.\nDemmy applied water, gauze, and dermabond tape from her medkit; the wound sealed. He scavenged a hand radio; Quincy tuned Three Shovels’ channel but got only static. They harvested three batteries, wiring pigtails, a flask of puro for the fuel cell, and a serviceable knife; ill-fitting bloody boots were discarded. Back underway, Quincy wrestled terrain and her unease at feeling a thrill after killing.\nAs power waned, they crested a hill and froze: grass ahead was flattened uniformly, and beyond lay a graveyard of intact-looking ravager vehicles—silent, unmanned. On the far side stood the Three Shovels Caravan in formation, equally silent, about three hundred meters away. Repeated radio calls met only static. Despite Demmy’s warning, Quincy insisted they go take a look and crept the two-seater down into the valley’s ominous quiet.",
    "dense_recap_250w": "Quincy and Demmy sprint south at dawn in their battered two-seater, the fuel cell having trickle-charged overnight. When a dust plume reveals a ravager four-seater intercepting them, they maintain speed to avoid suspicion, hide the shotgun, and smear soot as rough camouflage. At near point-blank range the ambushers’ oblivious head-banging ends: Demmy’s first shotgun shell misfires, he cycles another and destroys the passenger’s face as Quincy’s .45 drops the driver; a ravager round ricochets into their tube frame, nicking Quincy’s cheek. Demmy cleans and closes the wound with dermabond from the medkit. They salvage a handheld radio (tuned to the Three Shovels channel but only static), three batteries and wiring pigtails, a flask of puro for the fuel cell, and a straight-bar-guard knife; bloody boots don’t fit. Demmy notes killing for gear isn’t sustainable—ravagers on Sykotiq are faster—and Quincy acknowledges the risk while feeling a disquieting rush at decisive violence. Hours later, low on power, they crest a rise and encounter a disturbing anomaly: swathes of grass pressed flat in one direction, and in the valley a field of apparently operational ravager vehicles sitting motionless and empty. Beyond them, the Three Shovels Caravan stands silent in formation, roughly 300 meters past the ravagers. Multiple radio calls get only static. Despite Demmy’s caution, Quincy insists they approach to see if the caravan needs help, easing the two-seater into the unnaturally quiet basin.",
