    "full_scene_clean": "The dice rattled in the pan like bones as Quincy played Even-Odds in the Wildebeest, drinking puro but emotionally absent. Andreu tried to keep her steady. Gavin staggered in drunk, taunting Quincy about Robyn and declaring Mama Valorie had ended his arrangement with Robyn. He demanded a wager: just him and Quincy, one roll each—if he won, Quincy and Robyn were finished; if she won, he would leave them alone forever. Despite friends restraining her, Quincy, raw with grief and rage, drank on the pact and accepted. Gavin rolled first: fourteen. Quincy, nauseated and shaking, rolled and beat him by one. Gavin exploded, flipping a chair and storming into the night. Quincy’s victory felt hollow; shame and doubt crowded out relief as the players drifted away and she stumbled into the cool dark, fearing what Robyn would think of a future staked on dice.",
    "dense_recap_250w": "In the Wildebeest livestock trailer, Quincy sits through a late-night Even-Odds dice game to keep a low profile after recent tensions. Gavin, drunk and hostile, barges in, announces that Mama Valorie has broken off his pairing with Robyn, and goads Quincy with accusations that she didn’t fight for Robyn. He escalates to a high-stakes challenge: a single roll-off between the two of them. If he wins, Quincy must end things with Robyn; if she wins, he will leave them alone. Andreu warns Quincy not to engage, but provoked and exhausted, she seals the pact with a shared shot of puro. Gavin rolls a fourteen (4,5,5). Quincy, rattled by the possibility of losing Robyn on a gambler’s bet, throws and edges him by one. Gavin erupts—chair slams, the milk stool and rolling pan tumble—and he storms out. The room freezes, then empties. Quincy’s ‘win’ resolves the immediate threat but leaves her sick with shame for risking her relationship and community standing on a drunken wager. The scene crystallizes intersecting pressures: personal love versus public provocation, self-control versus rage, and the caravan’s social games as both refuge and flashpoint.",
