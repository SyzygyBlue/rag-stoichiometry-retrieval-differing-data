    "full_scene_clean": "As Demmy walks toward a fully-stocked six-seater, he second-guesses leaving Evelyn and questions his feelings. Deciding space will help them both, he focuses on action: rescuing Quincy and Chase. At the tailgate he retrieves gear he had removed before visiting Evelyn—on Brother Olafsen’s advice. He straps on a new 30-cm stiletto with a brass grip and guard, pockets six small blades, and checks a 10mm semiauto with four eight-round magazines. The vehicle is packed with supplies. He wonders if McTanner intended him to mount a rescue but didn’t ask directly. Planning to message McTanner and Evelyn, he powers up the nav computer and finds the Calum-Tam Holdfast already programmed. He engages the motors and drives out of Fox River, the weight of the earlier conversation lifting as the mission begins.",
    "dense_recap_250w": "On the way to a six-seat vehicle, Demmy wrestles with self-doubt about leaving Evelyn after she asked to slow their relationship. Concluding that distance will help them both sort their emotions, he pivots to a concrete mission: respond to rumors that Quincy and Chase are captive at the Calum-Tam Holdfast. At the tailgate he re-arms with equipment he’d removed before seeing Evelyn per Brother Olafsen’s guidance: a newly forged 30-cm stiletto with brass grip and finger guard crafted at McTanner’s request, six improved small blades stowed in chest pockets, and a 10mm semiautomatic pistol with four eight-round magazines. The six-seater is loaded with supplies and ammunition, signaling institutional support. Demmy suspects McTanner wants him to go, plans to message both McTanner and Evelyn, then starts the vehicle. The nav computer is already set to Calum-Tam, confirming the implied mission. He drives away from Fox River, his anxiety receding as purpose takes over. The scene bridges emotional withdrawal to operational readiness, establishes Demmy’s signature close-quarters kit, and places him en route to confront Calum-Tam over Quincy and Chase.",
