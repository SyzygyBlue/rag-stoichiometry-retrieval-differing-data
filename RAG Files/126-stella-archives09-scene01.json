    "full_scene_clean": "Shelly sits alone in a sleek Metrofederacy café, nursing a cold espresso while reviewing appeal Case 722301-B on her PID: an in-transit death after stimulant use; she recommends no reversal of the SAIR penalty. She tongue-taps to mark it ready for submission. She reflects on months of burnout, twenty-seven city hops, and a run of routine investigations whose outcomes reduce to checked boxes. The Forensic Investigator IV certification and MD are within reach—two exams remain—but she has not scheduled them. She scans another file as the café hums around her, thinking of an unsolved pattern: thirty-one men, including Randy, all coded as Failure to Thrive with matching logs. The work is still precise and thorough, but joyless. She wonders if she herself has begun to disappear, even as she keeps doing the job.",
    "dense_recap_250w": "On March 28, 2186, Shelly—Forensic Investigator III in the Metrofederacy—reviews an appeal case in a minimalist café. Case 722301-B challenges a cause-of-death ruling tied to stimulant use during transit; after interviews and log pulls, she concludes the outcome is proper and marks the appeal for submission, citing no grounds to overturn the SAIR penalty. Despite competence and diligence, she feels numb. Over six months she has made twenty-seven city hops handling incidents from warehouse fires to electrosurge blowouts, each ending with a signature and little meaning. She could advance to Forensic Investigator IV and receive an MD after two exams, but hasn’t scheduled them. The screen’s tint adapts to her retinal fatigue while she keeps working, haunted by an unresolved cluster: thirty-one male deaths, logs matching a prior subject named Randy, all summarized as Failure to Thrive. She realizes she’s going through motions—work, sleep, travel, repeat—drinking a cold espresso like it matters while questioning whether she still does. The scene captures her internal conflict between professional mastery and personal disengagement, and flags the ongoing Failure to Thrive pattern as a dormant investigation thread.",
