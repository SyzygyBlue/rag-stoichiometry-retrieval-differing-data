    "full_scene_clean": "The grief counselor wore gray and blue—calm colors. Neutral. Unimposing. Michelle stared at the woman's face across the table, knowing she wasn't really there. Those weren't even her clothes. Just another hologram. Worse, the story about Randy wasn't real to her. Yes, he was dead. After that, everything felt like a lie.\nHer name was Naomi. Stella had matched her to Michelle from telemetry and preferences. For thirty minutes Naomi tiptoed around Michelle’s only question. Patience gone, Michelle asked if Naomi understood the difference between grief and closure, then accused her of treating them as the same. Naomi dropped the smile and said the session had become a standoff. She acknowledged Michelle’s training, urged her to engage as a mother, not a counselor, and said she wasn’t the enemy.\nNaomi took a puff from a Vibe stick labeled “Chillaxer.” Michelle rejected numbing herself and swore. Naomi stayed empathetic. Michelle said something about the death didn’t make sense and begged for help. Naomi gently suggested beginning to let go and reminded her that Shelly still needed her.\nMichelle erupted: for two months she’d been denied where it happened, which pod, body condition, autopsy, biometrics, logs, labs—anything. Naomi said she had checked all legally accessible sources, but Randy was eighteen and had locked his records; Stella would not override. Michelle rejected that as unreasonable and challenged how anyone could die in the Metrofederacy with Traumalert and pervasive care. She demanded Naomi admit Randy shouldn’t be dead and suggested someone must have turned something off.\nMichelle then toggled off every health alert and monitoring setting in her PID to test the system and pulled a kitchen knife taped under the table. Naomi, alarmed, asked what she was doing as Michelle said she would show her.",
    "dense_recap_250w": "In a remote, tri-D counseling session, Michelle confronts Naomi, a Stella-matched holographic grief counselor, over the lack of closure surrounding her son Randy’s death. Michelle distinguishes grief from closure and accuses Naomi of conflating the two. Naomi drops her professional veneer, acknowledges Michelle’s credentials, and appeals to her as a mother in pain, insisting she is not the enemy. To steady herself, Naomi uses a ‘Chillaxer’ Vibe stick. The core dispute surfaces: Michelle has received no concrete facts—no location or pod, no body condition, no autopsy, biometrics, logs, or labs—despite the Metrofederacy’s pervasive healthcare and rapid response systems like Traumalert. Naomi explains she has checked all legally available channels; Randy, at eighteen, locked his records, and Stella will not violate adult consent. This hard boundary intensifies Michelle’s suspicion that safeguards failed or were disabled. To demonstrate a potential failure path, Michelle opens her PID interface, switches off all health alerts and monitoring, silences warnings, and produces a kitchen knife she previously taped under the table, intent on ‘showing’ what Traumalert does when protections are disabled. Naomi, alarmed, demands to know what Michelle is doing. The scene ends with a volatile standoff between a bereaved mother’s demand for truth and institutional privacy constraints.",
