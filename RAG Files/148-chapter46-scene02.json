    "full_scene_clean": "Lesha’s withdrawal has started: a crawling, electric ache under her skin. She clenches her jaw and fights the urge to dig into Quincy’s seat-bag for the two vials Quincy took from Lenya’s stash. Broken Bow is far; she tells herself to space the chems or she will come apart. She studies the others: Quincy—pragmatic, stoic, magnetic; Chase—the ex-politician’s son, maimed and fading, whose broken arm needs to be pulled straight and set soon or it will fester; Demmy—preternaturally aware, a ghost with a knife who would be terrifying with implants, if any psych eval would pass him. The scale of the catastrophe they are in chills her; she thinks of a city leveled, and the Blacklight Syndicate’s name makes her blood run cold. She has been a merc and a killer and once considered Blacklight, but they were far too hardcore even for her. She keeps staring at Quincy’s bag. A taste would stop the pain and light her up. Not yet. Get to Broken Bow. Find supply. Until then, do right by these kids. She breathes, wills the tremors down, and chooses—for now—to help them and not steal the vials, knowing the junk makes liars of everyone.",
    "dense_recap_250w": "Inside the moving TEG-6, Lesha wrestles with stimulant withdrawal while eyeing the two vials stashed in Quincy’s bag. She forces herself to delay dosing until they reach Broken Bow, calculating that using now will sabotage the long haul. Evaluating the team, she admires Quincy’s competence and presence, notes that Chase’s broken arm must be stretched and set soon to prevent infection, and recognizes Demmy’s exceptional situational awareness and reflexes—the kind of raw talent mercenary outfits covet, implants or not. The broader situation unnerves her: they are entangled in forces powerful enough to level a city, and the mention of the Blacklight Syndicate signals stakes beyond anything the trio understands. Lesha’s mercenary past and self-loathing surface; she once contemplated joining Blacklight but judged it too extreme. Temptation surges as she fixates on the bag—just a taste would stop the pain—but she recommits to spacing doses, helping the others, and waiting to resupply in Broken Bow. She sets a near-term medical priority for Chase, privately vows not to betray the group, and admits the hard truth: addiction turns intentions into lies. The scene frames Lesha’s internal battle between dependency and duty, while positioning her as a hardened guardian deciding, for now, to protect the younger survivors rather than feed her habit.",
