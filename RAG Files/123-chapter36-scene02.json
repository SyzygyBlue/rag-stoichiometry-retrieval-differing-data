    "full_scene_clean": "“There are so many messages here,” Quincy says, working the cabled keyboard through her AR glasses. Lesha sends two sorting filters to isolate traffic to/from outside the holdfast’s local domain. Quincy applies them and finds items mentioning Bivualier (reported dead), Dinh Tam getting a new contact, references to Jessop, and cross-traffic with Ransom Canyon (name: Makko). A message describes deciding to abduct or kill Quincy to suppress attention to the caravan; Metrofederacy money is implicated. Quincy panics about saving the messages. Lesha warns they’re out of time. Lenya appears in the doorway in a sheer sundress, pistol leveled. Tearful, then furious, she radios for six guards and Carl, then says, “Tell Father he was right.” Lenya taunts Lesha’s dependency; Lesha steps in front of Quincy and Chase but, shamed and wavering, retreats to a stool. The double doors close, plunging the bay into tense silence.",
    "dense_recap_250w": "In the warehouse autopacker bay, Quincy struggles to sift a mass of server messages through AR glasses until Lesha pushes her two filters that surface mail crossing the Calum-Tam holdfast’s domain boundary. The filtered set includes messages stating Councilman Bivualier is dead, that someone will get Dinh Tam a new contact, mentions of Jessop, and traffic with Ransom Canyon, including a participant named Makko. Critically, Quincy finds a message discussing abducting or killing her to stop scrutiny of the caravan incident, and notes that money is coming from the Metrofederacy. She asks if this connects to her missing family, while Chase, shaken, tells her to save the files. Before she can, Lesha warns they’re out of time. Lenya enters in a sheer sundress with a drawn pistol, grief turning to rage as she accuses Chase of breaking his promise. She radios orders for about six guards and requests Carl, then transmits, “Tell Father he was right.” Lenya weaponizes Lesha’s stim dependency to force compliance; after a brief, defiant shield posture, Lesha’s resolve collapses and she sits aside. The doors close, sealing the trio’s predicament, and leaving the status of the incriminating messages unresolved.",
