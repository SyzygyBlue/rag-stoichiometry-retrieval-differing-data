    "full_scene_clean": "Chase sits beside Demmy’s hospital bed, listening to beeps and the hiss of a blood pressure cuff while brooding about his mother’s control. Heavy boots approach; Quincy appears with bandaged, blood-stained hands. After brief banter, Quincy admits she was looking for him and explains she found a man snooping around the Three Shovels trucks, fought him, and likely broke his nose. The intruder fled to the motor pool and escaped in a Fox River two-seater. Chase suggests the target may not have been theft and proposes pulling the motor-pool video feed—if they reach it before it is wiped. Quincy resists being drawn into Fox River schemes but needs answers. They head out together, Chase leading toward the stairs and motor pool.",
    "dense_recap_250w": "At night in Fox River’s clinic, Chase keeps vigil over the recovering Demmy, wrestling with resentment toward his mother. Quincy arrives, hands bandaged and stained, and asks for help. She reports catching an unknown man with a flashlight at the Three Shovels trucks; after a brief fight in which she likely broke his nose, the man escaped by jumping into a Fox River two-seater at the motor pool. Chase questions the assumption of theft, noting pervasive cameras and maintenance discipline, and proposes they immediately retrieve the motor-pool security footage before it is erased. He refuses to speculate on who might do the wiping. Quincy, wary of involvement in Fox River politics and Chase’s family conflicts, nonetheless agrees because this could be her only lead on the caravan’s disappearance. They leave Demmy’s room at pace, intent on accessing the footage and identifying the intruder/driver.",
