    "full_scene_clean": "The ejector burned his fingers as Chase withdrew the magazine and jammed fresh .50 caliber rounds in. Blood dripped from his fingertips. No time to think. He feared the two defenders might already be dead. This was all or nothing. In the grass depression, he steadied himself, praying McTanner would arrive. A shadow fell—wild eyes, a combat knife flashing. A tattooed ravager, teeth metal-tipped, dropped onto him with a high-pitched squeal. The hot .50 lay across Chase’s chest; he heaved it up to deflect the blade. They crashed together. He clamped the knife wrist while the rifle’s heat scorched them both. Sykotiq-wide pupils: no pain, inhuman strength. Dirt fell into his face as the knife tore free of the ground. Chase held the attacker suspended by the wrist, groped for his pistol—empty holster. The ravager’s free hand smashed his nose; blood flooded his throat. Blindly sweeping behind his back, Chase finally found the sidearm tucked at his spine. The click of the safety made the ravager glance; three 10mm shots dropped him. Chase scrambled to the crest. Through the scope he saw the emaciated kid down and the dark-haired woman still fighting. He resumed firing, cutting down ravagers as she bled and battled with a captured rifle. Suddenly she pointed frantically up at him. A blade bit his back—his attacker had staggered up again, switching the knife to his left hand. Armor didn’t stop it; pain flared as the knife pulled free. Chase rolled, drew, and put two more rounds center mass. The ravager collapsed. Blood oozed down Chase’s back and into his boots. He turned back to the fight below as TRG vehicles streamed over the ridgeline in single file, arcing clockwise and mowing down the remainder. It was over. Chase gathered his gear and staggered downslope, light-headed, trying to wave as TRG troopers ran toward him. His vision tunneled and the ground tilted.",
    "dense_recap_250w": "Pinned on a hillside above a besieged caravan, Chase reloads his overheating .50 cal and fears the two defenders he’s been covering may already be dead. A Sykotiq-fueled ravager wearing a tattered leather coat and metal teeth ambushes him at the crest, crashing into his position with a combat knife. Using the hot rifle as a shield, Chase locks the man’s knife wrist while being punched and cut; unable to find his holstered sidearm, he finally locates it tucked at his back and fires three 10mm rounds to drop the attacker. He resumes sniping, seeing the emaciated youth down while the dark-haired woman continues fighting with a ravager rifle. She suddenly points toward him, warning of danger—the same ravager has staggered up again and stabs Chase between the shoulder blades, the blade penetrating his vest. Rolling away, Chase fires two more rounds center mass to finish the threat. Bleeding heavily, he keeps his focus on the caravan until Tactical Response Group (TRG) vehicles crest the hill in single file, encircle clockwise, and cut down the remaining ravagers. As the relief force parks and runs toward him, Chase, light-headed and soaked in blood, tries to wave before his vision blurs. The scene captures his near-fatal knife fight, sustained precision fire in support of the defenders, and the timely TRG arrival that ends the engagement.",
