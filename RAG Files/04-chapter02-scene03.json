    "full_scene_clean": "As trade day ends, Quincy is drained—not by trinkets and gold teeth, but by refusing desperate skervs who cannot afford water. She mirrors Emory’s hardness yet feels the guilt he seems to lack. A father offers a pendant braided from his daughter’s hair; Stan, pale, refuses as Davian gives a slow shake of his head. The man leaves with his sleeping child. Quincy forces herself to focus on paying customers: water, food, meds, some guns and ammo. She notices a thin teenage boy shimmy from under a Three Shovels truck toward a debris heap to hide until night; she considers calling him out but looks away, silently wishing him luck. Refugees recount fresh ravager attacks on holdfasts—machine guns, explosives, walls torn down with hooks and cables. Of roughly a hundred refugees, only twelve can afford passage with the caravan to Broken Bow; the rest beg or barter in vain. At dusk, the green flag is rolled up and the remaining skervs melt into the dark, leaving Quincy with no relief—only silence.",
    "dense_recap_250w": "Dusk settles on the Three Shovels’ hilltop market after a grueling day. Quincy reflects on the moral toll of pricing water beyond the reach of most skervs. A father pleads with a hair-braided pendant; Stan refuses under Davian’s policy. Quincy, once angry at Emory’s coldness, now performs the same refusals while feeling their weight. She tallies the pragmatic trades—water, food, meds, even weapons—knowing the caravan’s existence keeps payers alive while the penniless are turned away. Near closing, she spots a gaunt teen slipping from beneath a caravan truck to hide in scrap until nightfall; she debates sounding the alarm but lets him go, a deliberate breach of strictness for a flicker of humanity. Throughout the day, refugees describe coordinated ravager assaults on holdfasts with machine guns, explosives, and cable-hook breaching that topple walls. Out of about a hundred displaced people, only a dozen can purchase caravan passage toward Broken Bow Free City; the rest will wander as skervs. As the big green flag comes down and the line dissolves, Quincy feels no satisfaction—only the quiet ache of complicity and exhaustion.",
