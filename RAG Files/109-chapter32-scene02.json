    "full_scene_clean": "Evelyn showered, dressed, and floated out of her dormitory, her head in the clouds, thinking of Demmy. She aimed for requisition and supply to get a new communicator, but the early hour meant the door was locked. Cool metal under her fingers contrasted with heat in her cheeks. I'm a mess. Conflicting emotions surged: the warmth of his embrace and the wildfire of his kiss versus fear at the speed of it all. She craved solitude and a book, yet also his presence. I'll get a cup of caf. I need some time to think. She bought a caf at a nearby cafe and sat on a small bench outside the locked door. Steam curled and vanished as she sipped, settling her nerves. What is happening to me? She was supposed to befriend him, keep him occupied with studies, guide him toward God, show him the Order could be trusted. Instead… She recalled her quiet childhood, a bookish daughter of a schoolteacher and a welder, overshadowed by a rambunctious brother; no one was surprised when she joined the Order. But now there was Demmy—strength, vulnerability, conviction—pulling at her. She saw his pain and felt fierce protectiveness. \"He doesn't deserve this,\" she whispered. \"He deserves so much better—so much more.\" Maybe she could help him find it. Doubt rose: timid, rule-abiding Evelyn. Another voice asked: What if it could be? Had anyone needed her before? No. But someone needs me now. A shy smile bloomed; fear mixed with rightness. Chin lifted, she noticed the OPEN light on the supply door gleam—an omen for the morning.",
    "dense_recap_250w": "Evelyn leaves her dorm in an elated haze, intent on replacing her communicator at requisition and supply. Arriving too early, she finds the door locked and feels the cool metal as heat rises in her cheeks, recognizing she is emotionally scattered. Torn between retreating to quiet solitude and seeking Demmy’s presence, she opts to buy a caf and sit on a bench outside to think. As she sips, steam dissipating like her thoughts, she confronts a conflict between her duty and her desire: she was meant to befriend Demmy, keep him focused on studies, and guide him toward trust in the Order and in God, but her feelings have accelerated beyond her plan. She reviews her past—studious, rule-abiding, the bookish daughter of a schoolteacher and a welder, unsurprising recruit to the Order—and contrasts it with her present pull toward Demmy’s strength, vulnerability, and conviction. She voices that he deserves better and wonders if she could help him find it. Self-doubt surfaces (“timid, rule-abiding Evelyn”), yet a counter-voice suggests change: perhaps she could be needed. This resolves into tentative purpose as she lifts her chin; at that moment, the OPEN light on the supply door turns on, a small auspicious sign at daybreak. The scene closes with Evelyn steadying her resolve to support Demmy while acknowledging the risks and uncertainty ahead.",
