    "full_scene_clean": "Demmy sleeps and heals in Fox River’s medical ward under steady nursing, PT from a bearded nurse named Zeke, and follow-up surgeries/tissue regrowth that saved him from otherwise fatal chest/abdomen bullet wounds. A dentist repairs and cleans his teeth. Inventorying his few belongings, he finds the broken-screen camera and a scavenged datapad from a ravager camp; he connects it to an omnicharger to power up later. He rereads but does not destroy Chase’s note, which mentions Councilman Bivualier and suspicions reaching up to Brother Jessop; Demmy pockets it. Despite safety, PTSD-like fears surge when waking—afraid it will all vanish—yet the comfort of hot food and clean sheets makes him resolve never to be a skerv again. He vows to help Quincy and Chase without risking his new place in Fox River. Two clergy arrive: Brother Olafsen (with a leatherbound book) and Brother Ernesto (with a water pitcher and white cloth), wearing red scarves with the Order’s symbol. Introduced by Zeke as from the Divine Order of the Sanctifying Flame, they keep respectful distance after Zeke notes Demmy’s crowding anxiety. They gently ask about his years in the wildlands; he estimates three years alone since his mother died, making him roughly sixteen. Asked about faith, he recalls fragments of Psalm 23 but cannot bear to hear it; he asks them simply to pray. Ernesto washes his feet while Olafsen prays a litany. Exhausted, Demmy falls asleep.",
    "dense_recap_250w": "In Fox River’s med ward, Demmy’s recovery advances under Zeke’s therapy; surgeons have repaired otherwise fatal wounds, and a dentist restores his teeth. He inventories items: a broken camera and a scavenged datapad he puts on an omnicharger. He rereads Chase’s note referencing Councilman Bivualier and suspicions involving Brother Jessop, memorizes it, and keeps it instead of destroying it. Traumatic memories make him fear waking to find comfort gone, strengthening his resolve never to return to skerv life. He wants to aid Quincy and repay Chase but not at the cost of losing safety in Fox River. Responding to his earlier request, two clergy—Brother Olafsen and Brother Ernesto of the Divine Order of the Sanctifying Flame—visit, wearing red scarves marked with the Order’s symbol. Zeke warns them Demmy dislikes crowding. They ask about his past; he shares that his mother died three winters ago and he likely spent three years alone in the wildlands, making him about sixteen. When prompted about faith, he recalls only the start of Psalm 23 and asks for prayer instead. Ernesto performs a humble foot-washing with a pitcher and towel while Olafsen recites a litany. The emotional release and exhaustion send Demmy back to sleep, his intention fixed on helping Quincy/Chase while securing belonging.",
