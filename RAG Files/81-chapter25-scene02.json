    "full_scene_clean": "Chase wakes in his cell to faint rhythmic tapping from Quincy's adjoining cell. He whispers and finds Quincy shaping a piece of fence wire into a key. She explains she smuggled the wire past strip searches by hiding it between lip and gum, and that simple locks can be picked like any machine. Despite Chase’s warnings about armed guards and cameras, Quincy insists on escaping tonight—steal a cart from the motor pool and run for Broken Bow—because waiting endangers her missing family. She proves the method by opening and relocking her own door, then starts on his. Footsteps and a key rattle approach: Carl the overseer. Chase urges Quincy to hide. To buy her time, Chase deliberately provokes Carl—singing a loud, mocking Fox River folk song, “Froggy and the spider,” from his cot. Enraged, Carl unlocks Chase’s door, storms in, and drags him out into the hall as Chase keeps singing, accepting the imminent beating to divert attention from Quincy’s tampering.",
    "dense_recap_250w": "In the Calum–Tam cellblock at night, Chase hears Quincy tapping and discovers she’s fashioned a makeshift key from fence wire she hid in her mouth to evade strip searches. Confident the slave-pen locks are simple, Quincy test-opens her own cell, relocks it, and moves to free Chase. He argues the escape plan is suicidal given guards and cameras, but Quincy rejects delay—she must try tonight to reach the motor pool, steal a cart, and race toward Broken Bow to find her family. As she works Chase’s lock, footsteps and a key ring approach: Carl, the violent overseer. Chase hisses for Quincy to hide. Knowing discovery would mean severe punishment or worse, Chase makes a deliberate, sacrificial distraction. He lies on his cot and belts a raucous Fox River folk tune—‘Froggy and the spider’—to draw Carl’s full fury. The plan works: Carl unlocks the door, storms inside, and hauls Chase into the corridor, threatening a beating while Chase keeps up the defiant singing. The scene leaves Quincy briefly unobserved with a smuggled wire key and motivation to act, while Chase intentionally becomes the target to protect her window of escape.",
