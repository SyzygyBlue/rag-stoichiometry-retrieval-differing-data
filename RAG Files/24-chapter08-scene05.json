    "full_scene_clean": "“Ravagers!” The lookout’s cry cracked the air. Panic surged as tents collapsed, ropes were yanked, and fires were snuffed. Caravanners executed a rapid, practiced breakdown; outside sale tables were folded and stowed. Refugees—over forty—were crammed into the Wildebeest livestock trailer. A scarecrow-thin kid clung to a truck’s back and no one stopped him. The .50-cal machine gun roared, its flashes punching through dust. Return fire from a swarm of oncoming vehicles sparked ricochets. A woman screamed. Quincy helped hoist the hissing camp stove into a truck bed and pin it down. A geyser of oily smoke rose in the distance—at least one ravager vehicle burned. Davian barked, “Gunners, positions!” Belts clinked, chocks yanked, electric motors whined. Riflemen strapped in. Quincy climbed atop the Gooch, a rifle slung over her back, forcing herself to ignore her missing toolbox. The enemy force was the largest she had seen. The Three Shovels trucks and trailers uncoiled into a single file, pulling out like a metal serpent. Quincy tucked her pack, jacked a round into the chamber, sighted into the dust, and waited for a target to come into range.",
    "dense_recap_250w": "A lookout’s warning of a massive ravager force triggers a rapid, disciplined evacuation of the Three Shovels encampment on sale day. Caravanners dirty-stow tents and gear within moments, load more than forty refugees into the Wildebeest livestock trailer, and mount defensive positions. The camp stove is slammed into a truck bed and secured while heavy weapons spin up. A .50-cal machine gun thunders, and return fire crackles from the oncoming swarm; a plume of oily black smoke marks at least one enemy vehicle knocked out. Davian coordinates the defense with crisp orders—“Gunners, positions!”—as belts clink, chocks are yanked, and motors whine. Quincy, still missing her toolbox, prioritizes survival: she assists with stowage, scrambles onto the truck called the Gooch, chambers a round in her rifle, and sights into the roiling dust cloud. The caravan snakes out in single file, transforming from a market into a moving fortress. The scene ends with Quincy braced on overwatch, waiting for anything to emerge within range, the moral weight of leaving behind bystanders mingling with the urgency of flight under fire.",
