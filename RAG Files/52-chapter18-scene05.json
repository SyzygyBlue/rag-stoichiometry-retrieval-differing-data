    "full_scene_clean": "Chase lay on his side, staring at his battered reflection in the shattered med bus window, wondering if he could defy his unstoppable mother again. Pain throbbed in his swollen nose as he thought of Quincy and Demmy—Demmy likely in surgery at Fox River, Quincy with a vanished family. He decided he needed sleep and information before choosing his next move. Footsteps: Master McTanner boarded, uneasy. Chase tried a wry line about needing a drink. McTanner sat and admitted the problem: the Chancellor—Chase’s mother—had demanded his apprenticeship be terminated; now she wanted him back in the Tactical Response Group. Chase asked why Jeb hadn’t told him earlier; Jeb said he’d tried to shield Chase’s relationship with his mother, taking the blame himself, and swore never to do that again. Chase cut in that the reinstatement was political—‘hero returning’ optics instead of ‘reckless son disciplined.’ McTanner confirmed there would be congratulations, maybe a medal, but also discipline for Chase’s stunt once he healed. Chase accepted the training so long as his mother wasn’t pulling the strings. He promised never to do something like that again—maybe a lie, he thought; when you’re fighting for your right to exist, nothing’s off the table. After McTanner left, Chase stared at the roof, more determined than ever to get out from under his mother’s shadow.",
    "dense_recap_250w": "Inside the Dorothea Dix med bus, Chase struggles with pain, self-doubt, and the political whiplash surrounding his TRG status. He worries about Quincy’s missing family and Demmy’s fragile condition, but recognizes he lacks information to act. Master McTanner arrives, visibly uneasy, and levels with him: the Chancellor—Chase’s mother—ordered his termination earlier and now has reversed course, requiring that he remain in Tactical Response for political optics. Chase demands honesty and says he’s tired of manipulation; McTanner apologizes for hiding the source of the decision, claiming he’d tried to protect Chase’s relationship with his mother. Chase articulates the spin: from ‘reckless son disobeyed orders’ to ‘hero aids a caravan against ravagers.’ McTanner confirms ceremonial praise may await back in Fox River, but warns that once Chase heals, he’ll face strict discipline for acting alone. Chase accepts the discipline if independent of his mother’s control, promises not to repeat the stunt (while internally doubting that promise), and resolves to reclaim agency over his life. The scene crystallizes tensions among personal autonomy, mentorship, and a mother’s political power shaping the narrative around him.",
