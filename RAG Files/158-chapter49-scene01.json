    "full_scene_clean": "Shelly arrives on a wildlands tarmac under harsh sun and meets two StellaNet journalists: Alejandro (confident anchor) and Werner (gaunt cameraman with synthetic Nikon-labeled eyes). A cyan dispatch path leads her aboard their quadrafan. In flight toward Fox River, the devastation eclipses her expectations: a blackened expanse of twisted metal, shattered containers, collapsed concrete, and visible bodies in sludge. She loads her PID’s Explosive Vector Analysis Toolkit (EVAT), inputs crater geometry, fracture vectors, char patterns, debris arcs, terrain overlays, and produces a model indicating massive yield from explosives buried meters deep beneath the city core—likely ammonium-nitrate based, pre-placed, and remote-fused. She concludes it was deliberate and required insider infrastructure access over months. Shelly proposes witness interviews on the outskirts beyond the core blast radius where survivors might exist. She asks Werner to retask a thermal drone for low-altitude IR sweeps along the edge and to stream data to her for filtering. Alejandro and Werner agree as the quadrafan banks over the ruins.",
    "dense_recap_250w": "On 6 Dec 2186, Shelly disembarks at a wildlands airstrip and meets StellaNet reporters Alejandro and Werner, then lifts off in their quadrafan for Fox River. From the air she observes catastrophic destruction: peeled infrastructure, rebar like ribs, shipping containers crushed, visible corpses in pooled sludge. Initiating her PID’s Explosive Vector Analysis Toolkit, Shelly maps blast radius, fracture vectors, char patterning, debris arcs, and overlays terrain from Werner’s drone feeds. Iterations converge on a deep-buried, high-tonnage explosive—likely ammonium nitrate—placed under the city’s core and remote-fused. She rejects a surface car bomb theory and asserts an inside job requiring months of prep, heavy logistics, and privileged access. To build leads, she targets the periphery rather than the crater: anyone at the edges might have been knocked out, trapped, or displaced but still alive. Shelly requests Werner reprogram a thermal drone for low-altitude IR scans around the blast boundary and pipe the stream to her for triage of false positives. Alejandro underscores the human toll and lack of a census; Shelly focuses on locating witnesses whose accounts could point to responsible insiders. The team aligns on immediate next steps: IR grid sweeps, survivor identification, and witness interviews to crack a deliberately engineered mass-casualty event.",
